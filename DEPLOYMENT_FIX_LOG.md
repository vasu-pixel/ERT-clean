# Render Deployment Fix Log
**Date:** October 9, 2025
**Issue:** Reports queued but not processing - worker crashes on Render

---

## Problems Identified

### 1. **Gunicorn Worker Crashes Killing Background Thread**
- **Symptom:** Ticker added to queue, but no processing occurs
- **Root Cause:** Gunicorn's multi-worker architecture was restarting workers, killing the daemon background thread that processes reports
- **Log Evidence:**
  ```
  [2025-10-09 05:46:50 +0000] [38] [INFO] Handling signal: term
  [2025-10-09 05:46:50 +0000] [48] [INFO] Worker exiting (pid: 48)
  INFO:production_server:Background real report generator worker started
  ```

### 2. **yfinance Rate Limiting**
- **Symptom:** "Too Many Requests. Rate limited. Try after a while."
- **Root Cause:** Render's shared IP getting rate limited by Yahoo Finance
- **Impact:** Stock validation failing at `/api/generate`, preventing queue addition

### 3. **Missing API Keys in Render Environment**
- **Symptom:** FMP and Alpha Vantage failing to return data
- **Root Cause:** API keys not configured in `render.yaml`
- **Log Evidence:**
  ```
  INFO:production_server:FMP failed, trying Alpha Vantage for AAPL
  WARNING:production_server:Alpha Vantage returned no quote for AAPL
  ```

## Solutions Implemented

### ✅ Fix 1: Single-Worker Gunicorn Configuration
**File:** `gunicorn_config.py` (new)

```python
workers = 1  # Critical: Only 1 worker for background thread persistence
worker_class = 'gthread'
threads = 4
timeout = 120
max_requests = 1000
```

**Why:** Single worker prevents thread loss during worker restarts. Threads handle concurrency.

### ✅ Fix 2: Gunicorn Lifecycle Hooks
**File:** `wsgi.py`

Added proper hooks:
- `on_starting()` - Initialize directories before workers spawn
- `post_fork()` - Start background worker ONLY in first worker
- `worker_int()` / `worker_abort()` - Graceful shutdown logging

**Key Code:**
```python
def post_fork(server, worker):
    global _worker_started
    if worker.age == 0 and not _worker_started:
        logger.info(f"Starting background report worker in worker {worker.pid}")
        start_background_worker()
        _worker_started = True
```

### ✅ Fix 3: Aggressive Cache Strategy for Rate Limits
**File:** `production_server.py`

Changes:
- Increased cache TTL: 5 min → **30 min** (1800s)
- Added 24-hour stale cache fallback for rate limit scenarios
- Improved cache hit logging with age reporting

**Key Code:**
```python
CACHE_TTL = 1800  # 30 minutes

# Return stale cache up to 24 hours old during rate limits
if time.time() - timestamp < 86400:
    logger.info(f"Returning stale cache for {ticker} (age: {int((time.time() - timestamp)/3600)}h)")
    return cached_data

# Special handling for rate limit errors
if "rate limit" in error_msg.lower():
    if stale_entry:
        logger.warning(f"RATE LIMITED - Serving stale cache (age: {int((time.time() - stale_entry[1])/3600)}h)")
        stock_info_cache[cache_key] = (stale_entry[0], time.time())
        return stale_entry[0]
```

### ✅ Fix 4: Added API Keys to Render Environment
**File:** `render.yaml`

Added environment variables:
```yaml
- key: FMP_API_KEY
  value: p7sp5jCKkOpy7wqr7L5GK2rM5D2IdTzw
- key: ALPHA_VANTAGE_API_KEY
  value: Q4JQUU2KXA60C7CF
- key: POLYGON_API_KEY
  value: hbHwrUsCwbKfBSMyZiFZnpyMTda0wDgC
- key: FINNHUB_API_KEY
  value: d3fbrhhr01qolknci54gd3fbrhhr01qolknci550
- key: NEWSAPI_KEY
  value: d6ae866f7e644e3c9e8c1d3a5b8e2395
```

### ✅ Fix 5: Idempotent Background Worker Start
**File:** `production_server.py`

Added thread-safe singleton pattern:
```python
_background_worker_running = False
_background_worker_lock = threading.Lock()

def start_background_worker():
    with _background_worker_lock:
        if _background_worker_running:
            logger.warning("Background worker already running - skipping duplicate start")
            return False
        # ... start worker
        _background_worker_running = True
```

## Deployment Steps

1. **Commit and push changes:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix Render deployment: single-worker Gunicorn, rate limit handling, API keys"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. **Render will auto-deploy** (if connected to GitHub)

3. **Manual deploy** (if needed):
   - Go to Render dashboard
   - Click "Manual Deploy" → "Deploy latest commit"

4. **Verify deployment:**
   - Check `/health` endpoint returns 200
   - Monitor logs for: `✅ Background report generator worker started`
   - Test report generation with a ticker

## Expected Log Output (Success)

```
INFO:production_server:✅ Background report generator worker started (thread: ReportGeneratorWorker)
[2025-10-09 XX:XX:XX +0000] [54] [INFO] Starting gunicorn 23.0.0
[2025-10-09 XX:XX:XX +0000] [54] [INFO] Listening at: http://0.0.0.0:10000 (54)
INFO:production_server:Returning cached data for AAPL (age: 45s)
INFO:production_server:Added AAPL to report queue with ID: AAPL_1759988762
INFO:production_server:Dequeued report for processing {"report_id": "AAPL_1759988762", "ticker": "AAPL"}
INFO:src.utils.remote_llm_client:Initialized remote LLM client for https://...ngrok-free.dev
```

## Monitoring Checklist

- [ ] Single Gunicorn worker running (`[INFO] Booting worker with pid: XX` appears once)
- [ ] Background worker thread started (`✅ Background report generator worker started`)
- [ ] No worker restarts during report generation
- [ ] Cache hits for repeated ticker lookups
- [ ] FMP API working (check for "Fetching stock info from FMP API" success)
- [ ] Reports completing end-to-end

---

## Rollback Plan

If issues persist:

1. Revert to previous commit:
   ```bash
   git revert HEAD
   git push origin main
   ```

2. Alternative: Use 2 workers with external queue (Redis/Celery)
   - Requires Render paid plan for Redis addon
   - Out of scope for free tier

---

## Additional Notes

- **Free tier limitations:** Render free tier may still have cold starts (service sleeps after 15 min inactivity)
- **Rate limit mitigation:** Consider paid FMP plan for higher limits if usage scales
- **Worker restarts:** `max_requests = 1000` will restart worker after 1000 requests (prevents memory leaks)
- **Vast.ai LLM backend:** Ensure ngrok URL is stable and LLM service is running
