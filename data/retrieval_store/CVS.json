Estimated useful\nlives generally range from 10 to 40 years for buildings and improvements, 3 to\n10 years for fixtures and equipment, and 3 to 10 years for leasehold\nimprovements. Maintenance and repair costs are charged directly to expense as\nincurred. Major renewals or replacements that substantially extend the useful\nlife of an asset are capitalized and depreciated.",
