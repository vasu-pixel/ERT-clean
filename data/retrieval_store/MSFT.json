Revenue growth rates reflected the continued adoption\nof Windows operating systems and Microsoft Office, particularly as Microsoft\nsoftware is deployed across entire corporate, academic, and governmental\norganizations.  Software license volume increases have been the principal factor\nin the Company's revenue growth.  The average selling price per license has\ndecreased, primarily because of general shifts in the sales mix from retail\npackaged products to licensing programs, from new products to product upgrades,\nand from stand-alone desktop applications to integrated product suites.  Average\nrevenue per license from original equipment manufacturer (OEM) licenses and\norganizational license programs is lower than average revenue per license from\nretail versions.  Likewise, product upgrades have lower prices than new\nproducts.  Also, prices of integrated suites, such as Microsoft Office and\nBackOffice, are less than the sum of the prices for the individual programs\nincluded in these suites when such programs are licensed separately.  During\neach of the three years, an increased percentage of products and programs\nincluded elements that were billed but unearned and recognized ratably, such as\nMicrosoft Windows, Microsoft Office, maintenance, and other subscription models.\nSee accompanying notes to financial statements.",

A new accounting rule that\ninterprets American Institute of Certified Public Accountants (AICPA) Statement\nof Position (SOP) 97-2, Software Revenue Recognition, requires companies to use\nthe average sales price of each undelivered element of software arrangements.\nPrior authoritative guidance allowed a comparison of the total price\ndifferential between a licensed product sold through different channels of\ndistribution to derive the value of undelivered elements offered to customers\nacquiring product from one channel but not the other.  Upon adoption of this new\nrule in the fourth quarter of fiscal 1999, the percentages of the total\narrangement treated as unearned decreased.  This change in the timing of revenue\nrecognition reduced the amount of Microsoft Windows and Microsoft Office sales\ntreated as unearned and increased the amount of revenue recognized upon\nshipment.  Additionally, as part of the Company's long range planning process\nand a review of product shipment cycles, it was determined that the life cycle\nof Windows should be extended from two years to three years.  The net impact of\nthese changes was to increase reported revenue $80 million in the fourth quarter\nof 1999.",

The VAR model is not intended to represent actual losses in fair value,\nbut is used as a risk estimation and management tool.  Assumptions applied to\nthe VAR model at June 30, 1999 include the following: normal market conditions;\nMonte Carlo modeling with 10,000 simulated market price paths; a 97.5%\nconfidence interval; and a 20-day estimated loss in fair value for each market\nrisk category.  Accordingly, 97.5% of the time the estimated 20-day loss in fair\nvalue would be nominal for foreign currency denominated investments and accounts\nreceivable, and would not exceed $95 million for interest-sensitive investments\nor $1.38 billion for equity securities.\n\n7\n<PAGE>\n\nPreviously, the Company used a sensitivity analysis to estimate interest rate\nand equity price risk.  A 10% increase in interest rates would have reduced the\ncarrying value of interest-sensitive securities by $128 million and $101 million\nat June 30, 1998 and 1999.  A 10% decrease in market values would have reduced\nthe carrying value of the Company's equity securities by $300 million and $1.37\nbillion at June 30, 1998 and 1999.",
