    "text": "Despite an overall revenue decline, net income increased 13% over the prior\nyear. An improved gross margin percentage, reduced selling and administrative\nexpenses, along with a lower net restructuring charge in fiscal 1999 compared\nto the prior year, primarily drove this increase. Excluding both the 1999 and\n1998 restructuring charges, our net income was relatively flat year on year.\nContinued cost control activities and the effect of improved inventory levels\non our margins were key factors that offset the effects of reduced revenues.\nRevenues decreased for the first time in five years. In the United States,\nrevenues declined by 8%, Asia Pacific's revenues reduced by over a third\ncompared to last year, while Europe revenues increased 8%. We put a\nconsiderable amount of effort into improving product buying patterns and, as a\nresult, the composition and levels of inventory resulted in improved gross\nmargins relative to a year ago. The activities associated with the fiscal 1998\nrestructuring charge helped to reduce selling and administrative expenses in\nfiscal 1999 by nearly $200 million. We continue to evaluate our cost structure\nin light of existing and planned revenue levels. In fiscal 1999, we took\nspecific action to improve operating efficiencies and reduce costs. Some of\nthese actions resulted in a restructuring charge in fiscal year 1999 (see\nbelow and Note 13 for a more complete analysis of this charge).",

Had this\ndecrease been measured in dollars constant with that of the prior year, the\nnet decrease would not have been materially different. The U.S., which\nrepresents our largest market segment, experienced the largest dollar\nreduction, decreasing $415.7 million, or 8%. Sales of U.S. footwear decreased\n7.3%, representing a decrease in pairs sold of 6.3% and a decrease in average\nselling price of 2.6%. The reduction in sales was primarily attributable to\nthe continued soft retail environment as retailers adjusted their buying\npatterns to avoid inventory build-ups. Revenues from nearly all customer\naccounts and distribution channels were down. However, certain product\ncategories improved over the prior year. Running, which is the largest U.S.\nfootwear category, increased 3%, and Brand Jordan improved by 23%. Basketball\nand Training (which together with Running and Brand Jordan comprise over 56%\nof the total U.S. footwear business) decreased 30% and 26%, respectively.\nApparel revenues in the U.S. decreased 11%. Three of the top five apparel\ncategories experienced revenue decreases, including: Branded Athletic (down\n20%); Accessories (down 30%); and Special Make-Up product (down 12%).

The increase over the prior year can be\nattributed to reduced levels of closeout product sales. In addition, we are\nselling a much greater percentage of our closeout product through our own\nfactory outlets, which has resulted in improved gross margins on close-out\nsales and lower reserves against our overall inventory. While sales of in-line\nproduct decreased 7%, our closeout sales decreased by 14%. As a result,\ndespite the decline in our in-line business in fiscal 1999, in-line sales\nincreased to 92.2% of our overall business, an increase of 60 basis points\nover the prior year. Reducing our inventory levels was a key initiative for\nNIKE in fiscal year 1999. Our finished goods inventory decreased in all\nregions, most notably in Asia Pacific, which decreased 31%, Europe, which\ndecreased 26%, and the U.S., which decreased 4%. Aggressive selling of U.S.\napparel closeout inventories, and the effects of the foreign exchange rates on\nnon-U.S. sales, predominately in Europe, negatively affected gross margins.\nGross margins as a percentage of revenues should improve slightly in fiscal\n2000, primarily due to a much improved inventory position going into the year\ncompared with the same period last year.",

The Asian economic crisis and declining revenues in the United\nStates were the primary reasons for the lower earnings. Consumer spending\ndeclined considerably in Asia during fiscal 1998 as a result of macroeconomic\nissues facing that region. As a result, revenue growth in the Asia Pacific\nregion fell well short of our expectations, resulting in excess inventory\nlevels and increased levels of discounted product sales, both having a\nnegative impact on that region's gross margin percentage. Additionally,\nspending did not adjust as quickly as the sudden decline in revenue growth,\nresulting in significantly higher selling and administrative costs as a\npercentage of revenues in that region.",

The VaR determines the maximum potential\none-day loss in the fair value of foreign exchange rate-sensitive financial\ninstruments. The VaR model estimates assume normal market conditions and a 95%\nconfidence level. There are various modeling techniques that can be used in\nthe VaR computation. Our computations are based on interrelationships between\ncurrencies and interest rates (a \"variance/co-variance\" technique). We\ndetermined these interrelationships by observing foreign currency market\nchanges and interest rate changes over the preceding 90 days. The value of\nforeign currency options does not change on a one-to-one basis with changes in\nthe underlying currency rate. We adjusted the potential loss in option value\nfor the estimated sensitivity (the \"delta\" and \"gamma\") to changes in the\nunderlying currency rate. The model includes all of our forwards, options,\ncross-currency swaps and yen-denominated debt (i.e., our market-sensitive\nderivative and other financial instruments as defined by the SEC).\n\n22\n<PAGE>",

It also does not\nrepresent the maximum possible loss that may occur. Actual future gains and\nlosses will differ from those estimated because of changes or differences in\nmarket rates and interrelationships, hedging instruments and hedge\npercentages, timing and other factors.\n\nThe estimated maximum one-day loss in fair value on NIKE's foreign currency\nsensitive financial instruments, derived using the VaR model, was $10.9\nmillion and $11.7 million at May 31, 1999 and May 31, 1998, respectively.

Beginning in the first\nquarter of fiscal year 1997, the one month lag was eliminated. As a result,\nthe May 1996 charge from operations for these entities of $4.1 million was\nrecorded directly to retained earnings in the first quarter of fiscal year\n1997.\n\nRecognition of revenues:\n\nRevenues recognized include sales plus fees earned on sales by licensees.\nSales are recognized upon shipment of product.\n\nAdvertising and Promotion:",

Firmly committed transactions\nand the related receivables and payables may be hedged with forward exchange\ncontracts or purchased options. Anticipated, but not yet firmly committed,\ntransactions may be hedged through the use of purchased options. Premiums paid\non purchased options and any gains are included in prepaid expenses or accrued\nliabilities and are recognized in earnings when the transaction being hedged\nis recognized. Gains and losses arising from foreign currency forward and\noption contracts, and cross-currency swap transactions are recognized in\nincome or expense as offsets of gains and losses resulting from the underlying\nhedged transactions. Hedge effectiveness is determined by evaluating whether\ngains and losses on hedges will offset gains and losses on the underlying\nexposures. This evaluation is performed at inception of the hedge and\nperiodically over the life of the hedge. Occasionally, hedges may cease to be\neffective or may be terminated prior to recognition of the underlying\ntransaction. Gains and losses on these hedges are deferred and included in the\nbasis of the underlying transaction. Hedges are terminated if the underlying\ntransaction is no longer expected to occur and the related gains and losses\nare recognized in earnings. Cash flows from risk management activities are\nclassified in the same category as the cash flows from the related investment,\nborrowing or foreign exchange activity.
