The Company sold approximately 1.8 million iMac units in 1999,\nan increase of approximately 730,000 units or 68% over unit sales of similar\nproducts in 1998. Growth in unit sales was strong in all of the Company's\ngeographic operating segments, particularly in Japan and Asia Pacific due to\nstrong acceptance of iMac in those regions and the general economic improvements\nexperienced in much of Asia during the year. The Company also experienced\nimproved profitability in 1999. Operating income before special charges rose 44%\nor $118 million to $386 million in 1999 from $268 million in 1998. Contributing\nto the improvement in operating margin in 1999 was a rise in gross margin as a\npercentage of net sales to 28% as compared to 25% in 1998. The impact of\nimproved gross margins was partially offset by planned increases in recurring\noperating expenses during 1999 of 8% to a total of $1.337 billion.",

    "text": "Gross margin increased as a percentage of net sales during 1998 to 25% compared\nto 19% in 1997. This increase was primarily the result of a shift in revenue mix\ntoward the Company's higher margin Power Macintosh G3 systems and newer\nPowerBook G3 systems, the low volume of lower margin consumer products shipped\nduring the first three quarters of 1998, and the declining cost of various\ncomponents of the Company's products, particularly those sourced from Asia.\nImprovements in the Company's inventory management also contributed to the\nincrease in gross margins. During 1998, the Company simplified its product line,\nmoving from approximately 15 separate individual products to three main product\nfamilies. Further, the Company attempted to use as many industry standard parts\nin its newer products as possible, expanded the use of supplier hubs at\nmanufacturing sites, and outsourced the manufacture of printed circuit boards\nand some systems assembly. These changes have allowed the Company to more\naccurately forecast demand, reduce inventory carrying levels and related costs,\nlessen the financial exposure resulting from inventory obsolescence and excess\ninventory levels, and reduce the component cost of obtaining certain\nstandardized parts. The Company also made changes to its distribution model\nduring 1998 and 1997 that contributed to the increase in gross margins in 1998.\nThe Company significantly reduced the number of locations where it stages\nfinished goods, generally holding inventory on a regional basis rather than in\neach country. Also, the Company significantly reduced the number of its\ndistributors, authorized resellers, and national retail channel partners,\nparticularly in the United States. These changes allowed the Company to reduce\ninventory and related financial exposures and reduced the inventory and related\nfinancial exposure associated with inventory held in the Company's distribution\nchannels. The Company has also revised its distribution channel policies by\ndecreasing the price protection and stock return privileges of its distributors\nand resellers.",

During 1997, the\nCompany announced and began to implement supplemental restructuring actions to\nmeet the foregoing objectives of the plan. The Company recognized a\n$217 million charge during 1997 for the estimated incremental costs of those\nactions. All material restructuring actions contemplated under the plan were\nessentially complete at the end of fiscal 1998. The combined 1996 and 1997\nrestructuring actions consisted of terminating approximately 4,200 full-time\nemployees; canceling or vacating certain facility leases as a result of those\nemployee terminations; writing down certain land, buildings, and equipment to be\nsold as a result of downsizing operations and outsourcing various operational\nfunctions; and canceling contracts for projects and technologies that were not\ncritical to the Company's core business strategy.

SFAS No. 133 requires an entity to recognize all derivatives as\neither assets or liabilities in the statement of financial position and measure\nthose instruments at fair value. Derivatives that are not hedges must be\nadjusted to fair value through income. If the derivative is a hedge, depending\non the nature of the hedge, changes in fair value will either be offset against\nthe change in fair value of the hedged assets, liabilities, or firm commitments\nthrough earnings, or recognized in other comprehensive income until the hedged\nitem is recognized in earnings. In June 1999, SFAS No. 137, \"Accounting for\nDerivative Instruments and Hedging Activities--Deferral of the Effective Date of\nFASB Statement No. 133,\" was issued. The statement defers the effective date of\nSFAS No. 133 until the first quarter of fiscal 2001. Although the Company\ncontinues to review the effect of the implementation of SFAS No. 133, the\nCompany does not currently believe its adoption will have a material impact on\nits financial position or overall trends in results of operations and does not\nbelieve adoption will result in significant changes to its financial risk\nmanagement practices. However, the impact of adoption of SFAS No. 133 on the\nCompany's results of operations is dependent upon the fair values of the\nCompany's derivatives and related financial instruments at the date of adoption.",

The Company generally does not\nrequire collateral from counterparties, except for margin agreements associated\nwith the ten-year interest rate swaps on the Company's ten-year unsecured notes.\nTo mitigate the credit risk associated with these ten-year swap transactions,\nwhich mature in 2004, the Company entered into margining agreements with its\nthird-party bank counterparties. These agreements require the Company or the\ncounterparty to post margin only if certain credit risk thresholds are exceeded.\nThe amounts held in margin accounts were not significant as of September 25,\n1999.",

    "text": "In the second quarter of 1996, the Company announced and began to implement a\nrestructuring plan designed to reduce costs and return the Company to\nprofitability. The restructuring plan was necessitated by decreased demand for\nthe Company's products and the Company's adoption of a new strategic direction.\nThese actions resulted in a charge during 1996 of $179 million. During 1997, the\nCompany announced and began to implement supplemental restructuring actions to\nmeet the foregoing objectives of the plan. The Company recognized a\n$217 million charge during 1997 for the estimated incremental costs of those\nactions. All material restructuring actions contemplated under the plan were\nessentially complete at the end of fiscal 1998. The combined 1996 and 1997\nrestructuring actions consisted of terminating approximately 4,200 full-time\nemployees; canceling or vacating certain facility leases as a result of those\nemployee terminations; writing down certain land, buildings, and equipment to be\nsold as a result of downsizing operations and outsourcing various operational\nfunctions; and canceling contracts for projects and technologies that were not\ncritical to the Company's core business strategy. The restructuring actions\nunder the plan resulted in cash expenditures of $293 million and noncash asset\nwrite-downs of $95 million from the second quarter of 1996 through\nSeptember 25, 1999. Of the combined 1996 and 1997 restructuring charges of\n$396 million, approximately $3 million was determined to be excess during the\nfourth quarter of 1999 and was reversed. The remaining balance of $5 million as\nof September 25, 1999 is comprised of payments over the next two years on leases\nand contracts that had been terminated prior to fiscal 1999. The Company expects\nthe remaining accrual will result in cash expenditures of $5 million over the\nnext two years.",

As of September 25, 1999, a valuation\nallowance of $60 million was recorded against the deferred tax asset for the\nbenefits of tax losses that may not be realized. The valuation allowance relates\nto the operating loss carryforwards acquired from NeXT and to tax benefits in\ncertain foreign jurisdictions. The net change in the total valuation allowance\nin 1999 was a decrease of $153 million. Management believes it is more likely\nthan not forecasted income, including income that may be generated as a result\nof certain tax planning strategies, will be sufficient to fully recover the\nremaining net deferred tax assets.",
