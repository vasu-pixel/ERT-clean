BUSINESS\n \n     This Annual Report on Form 10-K and the documents incorporated herein by\nreference contain forward-looking statements based on current expectations,\nestimates and projections about the Company's industry, management's beliefs and\ncertain assumptions made by management. See \"Management's Discussion and\nAnalysis of Financial Condition and Results of Operations -- Forward-Looking\nStatements.\"\n \nGENERAL\n \n     Amazon.com, Inc. (\"Amazon.com\" or the \"Company\"), the Internet's number one\nbook, music and video retailer, opened its virtual doors on the Web in July\n1995. Amazon.com, one of the most widely known, used and cited commerce sites on\nthe Web, offers more than 4.7 million book, music CD, video, DVD, computer game\nand other titles. The Company offers its customers a superior shopping\nexperience by providing value and a high level of customer service. Amazon.com\nis a proven technology leader; it has developed electronic commerce innovations\nsuch as 1-Click ordering, personalized shopping services and easy-to-use search\nand browse features. Shopping at Amazon.com is fast and safe, incorporating a\nsimple ordering system, secure credit card transactions, e-mail communication\nwith customers and direct shipping worldwide.\n \n     The Internet is an increasingly significant global medium for online\ncommerce. According to Forrester Research, the total value of goods and services\npurchased over the Web was $43 billion in 1998 and is expected to increase to\n$1.3 trillion in 2003. Amazon.com believes it is well positioned to capitalize\non this growth. According to Media Metrix, approximately 16% of Web users\nvisited Amazon.com's stores in December 1998.\n \n     Amazon.com, Amazon.co.uk, Amazon.de, Internet Movie Database, Earth's\nBiggest Bookstore and 1-Click are either registered trademarks or trademarks of\nAmazon.com or its affiliates. All other names mentioned herein may be trademarks\nof their respective owners.\n \n     Information contained on the Company's Web sites is not deemed to be a part\nof this Annual Report on Form 10-K. As used herein, \"titles\" offered by the\nCompany means the items offered in the Company's catalogs and includes books,\nCDs, videotapes, audiotapes and other products.\n \n     Amazon.com was incorporated in 1994 in the state of Washington and\nreincorporated in 1996 in Delaware. The Company's principal corporate offices\nare located in Seattle, Washington. Amazon.com completed its initial public\noffering in May 1997 and its common stock is listed on the Nasdaq National\nMarket under the symbol \"AMZN.\"\n \nBUSINESS STRATEGY\n \n     The Company's objective is to become the best place to buy, find and\ndiscover any product or service available online. Amazon.com will continue to\nenhance and broaden its brand, customer base and electronic commerce expertise\nwith the goal of creating customers' preferred online shopping destination, in\nthe United States and around the world.\n \nAMAZON.COM WEB SITES\n \n     The Company believes that the sale of books, music and other products and\nservices over the Web can offer attractive benefits to customers, including\ngreater selection, convenience, ease-of-use, competitive pricing and\npersonalization. Customers entering Amazon.com Web sites can, in addition to\nordering books and other products, purchase gift certificates, conduct targeted\nsearches, browse highlighted selections, view bestseller lists and other\nfeatures, read and post reviews, register for personalized services, participate\nin promotions and check order status. The key components of Amazon.com's\nofferings include browsing, searching, reviews and content, recommendations and\npersonalization, 1-Click technology, secure credit\n \n                                        3\n<PAGE>   4\n \ncard payment and availability and fulfillment. The Company's Web sites promote\nbrand loyalty and repeat purchases by providing an inviting experience that\nencourages customers to return frequently and to interact with other customers.\n \n     Browsing. The Amazon.com sites offer visitors a variety of highlighted\nsubject areas, styles and special features arranged in a simple, easy-to-use\nfashion intended to enhance product search and selection. In addition, the Web\nsites present a variety of products and services and topical information. To\nenhance the customers' shopping experience and increase sales, the Company\nfeatures a variety of products and services on a rotating basis throughout the\nstores.\n \n     Searching. A primary feature of Amazon.com Web sites is its interactive,\nsearchable catalogs of more than 4.7 million books, music CD, video, DVD,\ncomputer game and other titles. The Company provides a selection of search tools\nto find books, music, video and other products based on keyword, title, subject,\nauthor, artist, musical instrument, label, actor, director, publication date or\nISBN. Customers can also use more complex and precise search tools such as\nBoolean search queries. The Company licenses some of its catalog and other\ninformation from third parties.\n \n     Reviews and Content. The Amazon.com stores offer numerous forms of content\nto enhance the customer's shopping experience and encourage purchases. Various\ntypes of content are available for particular titles, including cover art,\nsynopses, annotations, reviews by editorial staff and other customers, and\ninterviews by authors and artists.\n \n     Recommendations and Personalization. Amazon.com personalizes its product\nand service offerings. These features include greeting customers by name,\ninstant and personalized recommendations, bestseller and chart-topper listings,\npersonal notification services, purchase pattern filtering and a number of other\nrelated features. The Company believes that personalization of a customer's\nshopping experience at the Company's Web sites is an important element of the\nvalue proposition it offers to customers and intends to continue to enhance its\npersonalized services.\n \n     1-Click Technology. Amazon.com provides customers with a streamlined\nordering process using 1-Click technology. If a customer has previously\nactivated 1-Click functionality, a customer can place an order by clicking one\nbutton without having to fill out an order form. The customer's shipping and\nbilling information is automatically referenced on the Company's secure server.\n \n     Secure Credit Card Payment. Amazon.com utilizes secure server software for\nsecure commerce transactions. It encrypts all of the customer's personal\ninformation, including credit card number, name and address, so that it cannot\nbe read as the information travels over the Internet.\n \n     Availability and Fulfillment. Many of the Company's products are available\nfor shipment within 24 hours, others are available within two to three days and\nthe remainder are generally available within four to six weeks, although some\nproducts may not be available at all. Out-of-print books generally are available\nin one to three months, although some books may not be available at all.\nCustomers can select from a variety of delivery options, including overnight and\nvarious international shipping options, as well as gift-wrapping services. The\nCompany uses e-mail to notify customers of order status under various conditions\nand provides links to shipping carriers so that the customers can track their\nshipments. The Company seeks to provide rapid and reliable fulfillment of\ncustomer orders and to continue to improve its speed of availability and\nfulfillment.\n \n     Return Policy. Within 30 days following the customer's receipt of their\norder, Amazon.com will provide a full refund for any book in its original\ncondition, any Amazon.com recommended book in any condition, any unopened music\nCD, DVD, VHS tape or software, and any other merchandise item in new condition,\nwith its original packaging and accessories.\n \nPRODUCTS, SERVICES AND GEOGRAPHIC EXPANSION\n \n     Products. The Company has offered books for sale since July 1995. The\nCompany expanded its product offerings beyond books with the June 1998 launch of\nits music store. In the third quarter of 1998,\n \n                                        4\n<PAGE>   5\n \nits first full quarter of online music sales, Amazon.com became the number one\nonline music seller. In November 1998, Amazon.com launched its video store and\nan enhanced holiday gift store, offering a variety of products, including\nselected personal electronics and toy products. In the fourth quarter of 1998,\nits first quarter of online video sales, Amazon.com became the number one online\nvideo seller. The Company plans to continue to expand its product offerings.\n \n     Services. Amazon.com intends to broaden the scope of its business with the\ngoal of becoming customers' preferred destination for online shopping. In August\n1998, Amazon.com merged with Sage Enterprises, Inc. (\"PlanetAll\"), a Web-based\naddress book, calendar and reminder service, and Junglee Corp. (\"Junglee\"), a\nleading provider of Web-based virtual database technology, which allows visitors\nto access a variety of products sold by other merchants. The Company plans to\ncontinue to expand its service offerings.\n \n     Geographic Expansion. In April 1998, Amazon.com acquired three Internet\ncompanies in the United Kingdom and Germany. In October 1998, the Company\nre-launched two of these businesses under the Amazon brand. The Company\nincorporated Amazon.com's technology and look-and-feel into the European sites,\nwww.amazon.co.uk and www.amazon.de. During the fourth quarter of 1998, combined\nsales on the European sites significantly increased over the third quarter,\nestablishing Amazon.com as the number one online bookseller in these markets.\nFor discussion of segment and geographic information, see Note 1 of Notes to\nConsolidated Financial Statements.\n \nMARKETING AND PROMOTION\n \n     Amazon.com's marketing strategy is designed to strengthen the Amazon brand\nname, increase customer traffic to the Amazon.com Web sites, build customer\nloyalty, encourage repeat purchases and develop incremental product and service\nrevenue opportunities.\n \n     Amazon.com creatively applies technology to deliver personalized programs\nand services, as well as flexible merchandising. The Company employs a variety\nof media, business development and promotional methods to achieve these goals.\nThe Company also benefits from public relations activities as well as online and\ntraditional advertising, including radio, television and print media.\n \n     Associates Program. The Company extends its market presence through its\nAssociates Program, which enables associated Web sites to make products\navailable to their audiences with order fulfillment by Amazon.com. Approximately\n200,000 Web sites have enrolled in the Associates Program. Amazon.com associates\ninclude Yahoo! Inc. (\"Yahoo!\"), American Online, Inc. (\"AOL\"), Excite, Inc.,\nNetscape Communications Corporation, GeoCities, Microsoft Corporation and\nAltaVista Company.\n \n     Advantage for Books and Music. The Advantage program is designed to\nincrease the visibility and sales of titles from independent publishers,\nauthors, artists and labels. This free program provides the tools and framework\nto ensure their books and music appear more often, more prominently, and with\n24-hour availability throughout Amazon.com's catalogs of book, music and other\ntitles.\n \nCUSTOMER SERVICE\n \n     The Company believes that its ability to establish and maintain long-term\nrelationships with its customers and to encourage repeat visits and purchases\ndepends, in part, on the strength of its customer support and service operations\nand staff. Furthermore, the Company seeks to achieve frequent communication with\nand feedback from its customers to continually improve the Amazon.com stores and\nservices. The Company offers a number of e-mail addresses to enable customers to\nrequest information and to encourage feedback and suggestions. Users can also\ncontact customer service representatives via telephone 24 hours a day, 7 days a\nweek. The Company has automated certain of the tools used by its customer\nsupport and service staff and has plans for further enhancements.\n \n                                        5\n<PAGE>   6\n \nWAREHOUSING, FULFILLMENT AND DISTRIBUTION\n \n     The Company sources products from a network of distributors, publishers,\nlabels and manufacturers. Although the Company carries its own inventory (some\nof which is purchased directly from manufacturers), it also relies on rapid\nfulfillment from major distributors and wholesalers that carry a broad selection\nof titles. The Company purchases a majority of its products from Ingram Book\nGroup (\"Ingram\"), Baker & Taylor, Inc. (\"B&T\") and Valley Media, Inc. (\"Valley\nMedia\"). Ingram is the Company's single largest supplier and accounted for\napproximately 40% and approximately 60% of the Company's inventory purchases in\n1998 and 1997, respectively.\n \n     The Company utilizes automated interfaces for sorting and organizing its\norders to enable it to achieve rapid and economic purchase and delivery terms.\nFor orders that cannot be filled from the Company's inventory, the Company's\nproprietary software selects the orders that can be filled via electronic\ninterfaces with vendors and forwards the remaining orders to its special orders\ngroup. Under the Company's arrangements with distributors, electronically\nordered books often are shipped to the Company by the distributor within hours\nof a receipt of an order from Amazon.com. The Company has developed customized\ninformation systems and trained dedicated ordering personnel who specialize in\nsourcing out-of-print books and other hard-to-find products.\n \n     The Company intends to continue developing its distribution infrastructure\nto increase efficiency and to support greater customer demand. For example, in\nDecember 1998, Amazon.com leased a highly mechanized distribution facility in\nFernley, Nevada. The new facility, which is expected to begin operations in\n1999, should reduce standard shipping times to key markets in the western United\nStates. The facility will allow the Company to increase significantly the number\nof products maintained in inventory for rapid shipment to customers.\n \nTECHNOLOGY\n \n     The Company has implemented numerous site management, search, customer\ninteraction, recommendation, transaction-processing and fulfillment services and\nsystems using a combination of its own proprietary technologies and commercially\navailable, licensed technologies. The Company's current strategy is to focus its\ndevelopment efforts on creating and enhancing the specialized, proprietary\nsoftware that is unique to its business and to license or acquire commercially\ndeveloped technology for other applications where available and appropriate.\n \n     The Company uses a set of applications for accepting and validating\ncustomer orders, placing and tracking orders with suppliers, managing and\nassigning inventory to customer orders and ensuring proper shipment of products\nto customers based on various ordering criteria. The Company's transaction-\nprocessing systems handle millions of items, a number of different availability\nstatuses, gift-wrapping requests and multiple shipment methods and allow the\ncustomer to choose whether to receive single or several shipments based on\navailability. These applications also manage the process of accepting,\nauthorizing and charging customer credit cards. Amazon.com Web sites also\nincorporate a variety of search and database tools.\n \n     Systems administrators and network managers monitor and operate the\nCompany's Web sites, network operations and transaction-processing systems. The\ncontinued uninterrupted operation of the Company's Web sites and\ntransaction-processing systems is essential to its business and it is the job of\nthe site operations staff to ensure their reliability. The Company uses the\nservices of five Internet service providers to obtain connectivity to the\nInternet, both domestically and internationally, over multiple dedicated lines.\n \nCOMPETITION\n \n     The online commerce market, particularly over the Web, is new, rapidly\nevolving and intensely competitive. In addition, the retail book, music and\nvideo industries are intensely competitive. The Company's current or potential\ncompetitors include (1) online booksellers and vendors of other products such as\nCDs, videotapes and DVDs, (2) a number of indirect competitors, including Web\nportals and\n \n                                        6\n<PAGE>   7\n \nWeb search engines such as Yahoo! and AOL, that are involved in online commerce\neither directly or in collaboration with other retailers, (3) publishers,\ndistributors and retail vendors of books, music, video and other products,\nincluding Barnes & Noble, Inc. (\"Barnes & Noble\"), Bertelsmann AG\n(\"Bertelsmann\") and other large specialty booksellers and media corporations,\nmany of which possess significant brand awareness, sales volume and customer\nbases, and (4) traditional retailers who currently sell, or who may sell,\nproducts or services through the Internet. The Company believes that the\nprincipal competitive factors in its market are brand recognition, selection,\npersonalized services, convenience, price, accessibility, customer service,\nquality of search tools, quality of editorial and other site content, and\nreliability and speed of fulfillment.\n \n     As the online commerce market continues to grow, other companies may enter\ninto business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive\npositions. For example, in late 1998, (1) Bertelsmann announced that it\npurchased a 50% interest in Barnes & Noble's online venture, barnesandnoble.com\ninc., and intends to launch online stores in several countries, (2) Barnes &\nNoble announced its pending acquisition of Ingram, currently the Company's\nlargest single supplier, and (3) online music retailers CDnow, Inc. and N2K Inc.\nannounced a merger. The Company may not be able to compete successfully against\nthese and future competitors.\n \nINTELLECTUAL PROPERTY\n \n     The Company regards its patents, copyrights, service marks, trademarks,\ntrade dress, trade secrets, proprietary technology and similar intellectual\nproperty as critical to its success, and relies on trademark, copyright and\npatent law, trade secret protection and confidentiality and/or license\nagreements with its employees, customers, partners and others to protect its\nproprietary rights. The Company has applied for the registration of certain of\nits trademarks and service marks in the United States and internationally. In\naddition, the Company has filed U.S. and international patent applications\ncovering certain of its proprietary technology. Effective trademark, service\nmark, copyright, patent and trade secret protection may not be available in\nevery country in which the Company's products and services are made available\nonline. The Company has licensed in the past, and expects that it may license in\nthe future, certain of its proprietary rights, such as trademarks, technology or\ncopyrighted material, to third parties.\n \nEMPLOYEES\n \n     As of December 31, 1998, the Company employed approximately 2,100\nemployees. The Company also employs independent contractors. None of the\nCompany's employees are represented by a labor union, and the Company considers\nits employee relations to be good. Competition for qualified personnel in the\nCompany's industry is intense, particularly for software development and other\ntechnical staff. The Company believes that its future success will depend in\npart on its continued ability to attract, hire and retain qualified personnel.\n \nADDITIONAL FACTORS THAT MAY AFFECT FUTURE RESULTS\n \n     The following risk factors and other information included in this Annual\nReport should be carefully considered. The risks and uncertainties described\nbelow are not the only ones we face. Additional risks and uncertainties not\npresently known to us or that we currently deem immaterial also may impair our\nbusiness operations. If any of the following risks actually occur, our business,\nfinancial condition and operating results could be materially adversely\naffected.\n \n     We have a limited operating history. We incorporated in July 1994 and began\noffering products for sale on our Web site in July 1995. Accordingly, we have a\nrelatively short operating history upon which you can evaluate our business and\nprospects. You should consider our prospects in light of the risks, expenses and\ndifficulties frequently encountered by early stage online commerce companies. As\nan early-stage online commerce company, we have an evolving and unpredictable\nbusiness model, we face intense competition, we must effectively manage our\ngrowth and we must respond quickly to rapid changes in customer demands and\nindustry standards. We may not succeed in addressing these challenges and risks.\n \n                                        7\n<PAGE>   8\n \n     We have an accumulated deficit and anticipate further losses. We have\nincurred significant losses since we began doing business. As of December 31,\n1998, we had an accumulated deficit of $162.1 million. To succeed we must invest\nheavily in marketing and promotion and in developing our product, technology and\noperating infrastructure. In addition, the expenses associated with our recent\nacquisitions and interest expense related to the February 1999 issuance of our\n4 3/4% Convertible Subordinated Notes due 2009 (the \"Convertible Notes\") and the\nMay 1998 issuance of our 10% Senior Discount Notes due 2008 (the \"Senior\nDiscount Notes\") will adversely affect our operating results. Our aggressive\npricing programs have resulted in relatively low product gross margins, so we\nneed to generate and sustain substantially higher revenues in order to become\nprofitable. Although our revenues have grown, we cannot sustain our current rate\nof growth. Our percentage growth rate will decrease in the future. For these\nreasons we believe that we will continue to incur substantial operating losses\nfor the foreseeable future, and these losses may be significantly higher than\nour current losses.\n \n     Unpredictability of future revenues; potential fluctuations in quarterly\noperating results; seasonality. Due to our limited operating history and the\nunpredictability of our industry, we cannot accurately forecast our revenues. We\nbase our current and future expense levels on our investment plans and estimates\nof future revenues. Our expenses are to a large extent fixed. We may not be able\nto adjust our spending quickly if our revenues fall short of our expectations.\nFurther, we may make pricing, purchasing, service, marketing, acquisition or\nfinancing decisions that could adversely affect our business results.\n \n     Our quarterly operating results will fluctuate for many reasons, including:\n \n     - our ability to retain existing customers, attract new customers and\n       satisfy our customers' demand,\n \n     - our ability to acquire merchandise, manage our inventory and fulfill\n       orders,\n \n     - changes in gross margins of our current and future products, services and\n       markets,\n \n     - introduction of our new sites, services and products or those of\n       competitors,\n \n     - changes in usage of the Internet and online services and consumer\n       acceptance of the Internet and online commerce,\n \n     - timing of upgrades and developments in our systems and infrastructure,\n \n     - the level of traffic on our Web sites,\n \n     - the effects of acquisitions and other business combinations, and related\n       integration,\n \n     - technical difficulties, system downtime or Internet brownouts,\n \n     - introductions of popular books, music selections and other products or\n       services,\n \n     - our level of merchandise returns, and\n \n     - disruptions in service by common shipping carriers due to strikes or\n       otherwise.\n \n     Both seasonal fluctuations in Internet usage and traditional retail\nseasonality may affect our business. Internet usage generally declines during\nthe summer. Sales in the traditional retail book and music industries usually\nincrease significantly in the fourth calendar quarter of each year.\n \n     For those reasons, you should not rely on period-to-period comparisons of\nour financial results to forecast our future performance. Our future operating\nresults may fall below the expectations of securities analysts or investors,\nwhich would likely cause the trading price of our common stock to decline.\n \n     Intense competition. The online commerce market is new, rapidly evolving\nand intensely competitive. In addition, the retail book, music and video\nindustries are intensely competitive. Our current or potential competitors\ninclude (1) online booksellers and vendors of other products such as CDs,\nvideotapes and DVDs, (2) a number of indirect competitors, including Web portals\nand Web search engines, such as Yahoo! and AOL, that are involved in online\ncommerce either directly or in collaboration with other retailers, (3)\npublishers, distributors and retail vendors of books, music, video and other\nproducts, including Barnes & Noble, Bertelsmann and other large specialty\nbooksellers and media corporations, many of which possess significant brand\nawareness, sales volume and customer bases, and (4) traditional\n \n                                        8\n<PAGE>   9\n \nretailers who currently sell, or who may sell, products or services through the\nInternet. We believe that the principal competitive factors in our market are\nbrand recognition, selection, personalized services, convenience, price,\naccessibility, customer service, quality of search tools, quality of editorial\nand other site content, and reliability and speed of fulfillment.\n \n     Many of our current and potential competitors have longer operating\nhistories, larger customer bases, greater brand recognition and significantly\ngreater financial, marketing and other resources than we have. They may be able\nto secure merchandise from vendors on more favorable terms and may be able to\nadopt more aggressive pricing or inventory policies. They also can devote more\nresources to technology development and marketing than we can. We also expect to\nexperience increased competition from online commerce sites that provide goods\nand services at or near cost, relying on advertising revenues to achieve\nprofitability.\n \n     As the online commerce market continues to grow, other companies may enter\ninto business combinations or alliances that strengthen their competitive\npositions. For example, in late 1998, (1) Bertelsmann announced that it\npurchased a 50% interest in Barnes & Noble's online venture, barnesandnoble.com\ninc., and intends to launch online stores in several countries, (2) Barnes &\nNoble announced its pending acquisition of Ingram, currently our largest single\nsupplier, and (3) online music retailers CDnow, Inc. and N2K Inc. announced a\nmerger. We may not be able to compete successfully against these and future\ncompetitors.\n \n     Competition in the Internet and online commerce markets probably will\nintensify. As various Internet market segments obtain large, loyal customer\nbases, participants in those segments may use their market power to expand into\nthe markets in which we operate. In addition, new and expanded Web technologies\nmay increase the competitive pressures on online retailers. For example,\n\"shopping agent\" technologies permit customers to quickly compare our prices\nwith those of our competitors. This increased competition may reduce our\noperating margins, diminish our market share or impair the value of our brand.\n \n     Risks of system interruption. Customers' access to our Web sites directly\naffects the volume of orders we fulfill and thus affects our revenues. We\nexperience occasional system interruptions that make our Web sites unavailable\nor prevent us from efficiently fulfilling orders, which may reduce the volume of\ngoods we sell and the attractiveness of our products and services. These\ninterruptions will continue. We need to add additional software and hardware and\nupgrade our systems and network infrastructure to accommodate increased traffic\non our Web sites and increased sales volume. Without these upgrades, we face\nadditional system interruptions, slower response times, diminished customer\nservice, impaired quality and speed of order fulfillment, and delays in our\nfinancial reporting. We cannot accurately project the rate or timing of any\nincreases in traffic or sales volume on our Web sites and, therefore, the\nintegration and timing of these upgrades are uncertain.\n \n     We maintain substantially all of our computer and communications hardware\nat a single leased facility in Seattle, Washington. Our systems and operations\ncould be damaged or interrupted by fire, flood, power loss, telecommunications\nfailure, break-ins, earthquake and similar events. We do not have backup systems\nor a formal disaster recovery plan and we may not have sufficient business\ninterruption insurance to compensate us for losses from a major interruption.\nComputer viruses, physical or electronic break-ins and similar disruptions could\ncause system interruptions, delays, and loss of critical data and could prevent\nus from providing services and accepting and fulfilling customer orders.\n \n     We may have difficulty managing our growth. We have rapidly and\nsignificantly expanded our operations and will further expand our operations to\naddress potential growth of our product and service offerings and customer base.\nWe will expand our product and service offerings and our international\noperations and will pursue other market opportunities. We need to significantly\nexpand our distribution center network and improve our transaction-processing,\noperational and financial systems, procedures and controls. This expansion will\ncontinue to place a significant strain on our management, operational facilities\nand financial resources. Because it is difficult to predict sales increases, and\nlead times for developing distribution centers are long, we may over-expand our\nfacilities, which may result in excess inventory, warehousing, fulfillment and\ndistribution capacity. We also need to expand, train and manage our\n                                        9\n<PAGE>   10\n \nemployee base. Our current and planned personnel, systems, procedures and\ncontrols may not be adequate to support and effectively manage our future\noperations. We may not be able to hire, train, retain, motivate and manage\nrequired personnel or to successfully identify, manage and exploit market\nopportunities, which may limit our growth.\n \n     Risk of entering new business areas. We intend to expand our operations by\npromoting new or complementary products, services or sales formats and by\nexpanding our product or service offerings. This will require significant\nadditional expense and could strain our management, financial and operational\nresources. We cannot expect to benefit in these new markets from the\nfirst-to-market advantage that we experienced in the online book market. Our\ngross margins in these new business areas may be lower than our existing\nbusiness activities. We may not be able to expand our operations in a\ncost-effective or timely manner. Any new business that our customers do not\nreceive favorably could damage our reputation and the Amazon brand.\n \n     Risk of international expansion. We plan to expand our presence in foreign\nmarkets. We have relatively little experience in purchasing, marketing and\ndistributing products or services for these markets and may not benefit from any\nfirst-to-market advantages. It will be costly to establish international\nfacilities and operations, promote our brand internationally, and develop\nlocalized Web sites and stores and other systems. We may not succeed in our\nefforts in these countries. If revenues from international activities do not\noffset the expense of establishing and maintaining foreign operations, our\nbusiness, prospects, financial condition and operating results will suffer.\n \n     As the international online commerce market continues to grow, competition\nin this market will likely intensify. In addition, governments in foreign\njurisdictions may regulate Internet or other online services in such areas as\ncontent, privacy, network security, encryption or distribution. This may affect\nour ability to conduct business internationally.\n \n     Risks of business combinations and strategic alliances. We may expand our\noperations or market presence by entering into business combinations,\ninvestments, joint ventures or other strategic alliances with other companies.\nThese transactions create risks such as:\n \n     - difficulty assimilating the operations, technology and personnel of the\n       combined companies,\n \n     - disruption of our ongoing business,\n \n     - problems retaining key technical and managerial personnel,\n \n     - expenses associated with amortization of goodwill and other purchased\n       intangible assets,\n \n     - additional operating losses and expenses of acquired businesses, and\n \n     - impairment of relationships with existing employees, customers and\n       business partners.\n \n     We may not succeed in addressing these risks. In addition, the businesses\nwe acquired in 1998 are incurring operating losses.\n \n     Rapid technological change. Technology in the online commerce industry\nchanges rapidly. Customer functionality requirements and preferences also\nchange. Competitors often introduce new products and services with new\ntechnologies. These changes and the emergence of new industry standards and\npractices could render our existing Web sites and proprietary technology\nobsolete. To succeed, we must enhance Web site responsiveness, functionality and\nfeatures, acquire and license leading technologies, enhance our existing\nservices, develop new services and technology and respond to technological\nadvances and emerging industry standards and practices on a cost-effective and\ntimely basis. We may not be able to adapt quickly enough to changing customer\nrequirements and industry standards.\n \n     We depend on key personnel. We depend on the continued services and\nperformance of our senior management and other key personnel, particularly\nJeffrey P. Bezos, our President, Chief Executive Officer and Chairman of the\nBoard. We do not have long-term employment agreements with any of our key\npersonnel, and we do not have \"key person\" life insurance policies. The loss of\nany of our executive officers or other key employees could harm our business.\n \n                                       10\n<PAGE>   11\n \n     We rely on a small number of suppliers. We purchase a majority of our\nproducts from three major vendors, Ingram, B&T and Valley Media. In late 1998,\nBarnes & Noble, one of our largest competitors, announced an agreement to\npurchase Ingram. Ingram is our single largest supplier and supplied\napproximately 40% of our inventory purchases in 1998 and approximately 60% of\nour inventory purchases in 1997. Although we increased our direct purchasing\nfrom manufacturers during 1998, we continue to purchase a majority of our\nproducts from these three suppliers. We do not have long-term contracts or\narrangements with most of our vendors to guarantee the availability of\nmerchandise, particular payment terms or the extension of credit limits. Our\ncurrent vendors may stop selling merchandise to us on acceptable terms. We may\nnot be able to acquire merchandise from other suppliers in a timely and\nefficient manner and on acceptable terms.\n \n     We are highly leveraged. We have significant indebtedness. As of December\n31, 1998, we were indebted under our Senior Discount Notes, capitalized lease\nobligations and other asset financing. With the sale of the Convertible Notes in\nFebruary 1999, we incurred $1.25 billion of additional indebtedness. We may\nincur substantial additional debt in the future. Our indebtedness could:\n \n     - make it difficult to make principal and interest payments on the Senior\n       Discount Notes and the Convertible Notes,\n \n     - make it difficult to obtain necessary financing for working capital,\n       capital expenditures, debt service requirements or other purposes,\n \n     - limit our flexibility in planning for, or reacting to, changes in our\n       business and competition, and\n \n     - make it more difficult for us to react in the event of an economic\n       downturn.\n \n     We may not be able to meet our debt service obligations. If our cash flow\nis inadequate to meet our obligations, we may face substantial liquidity\nproblems. If we are unable to generate sufficient cash flow or obtain funds for\nrequired payments, or if we fail to comply with other covenants in our\nindebtedness, we will be in default. This would permit our creditors to\naccelerate the maturity of our indebtedness.\n \n     Risks associated with domain names. We hold rights to various Web domain\nnames, including \"Amazon.com,\" \"Amazon.co.uk\" and \"Amazon.de.\" Governmental\nagencies typically regulate domain names. These regulations are subject to\nchange. We may not be able to acquire or maintain appropriate domain names in\nall countries in which we do business. Furthermore, regulations governing domain\nnames may not protect our trademarks and similar proprietary rights. We may be\nunable to prevent third parties from acquiring domain names that are similar to,\ninfringe upon or diminish the value of our trademarks and other proprietary\nrights.\n \n     Governmental regulation and legal uncertainties. At this time, we face\ngeneral business regulations and laws or regulations regarding taxation and\naccess to online commerce. For example, expanding our distribution center\nnetwork may result in additional sales and other tax obligations. Regulatory\nauthorities may adopt specific laws and regulations governing the Internet or\nonline commerce. These regulations may cover taxation, user privacy, pricing,\ncontent, copyrights, distribution and characteristics and quality of products\nand services. Changes in consumer protection laws also may impose additional\nburdens on companies conducting business online. These laws or regulations may\nimpede the growth of the Internet or other online services. This could, in turn,\ndiminish the demand for our products and services and increase our cost of doing\nbusiness. Moreover, it is not clear how existing laws governing issues such as\nproperty ownership, sales and other taxes, libel and personal privacy apply to\nthe Internet and online commerce. Unfavorable resolution of these issues may\nharm our business.\n \n     Risks of uncertain protection of intellectual property. Third parties that\nlicense our proprietary rights, such as trademarks, patented technology or\ncopyrighted material, may take actions that diminish the value of our\nproprietary rights or reputation. In addition, the steps we take to protect our\nproprietary rights may not be adequate and third parties may infringe or\nmisappropriate our copyrights, trademarks, trade dress, patents and similar\nproprietary rights. Other parties may claim that we infringed their proprietary\nrights. We have been subject to claims, and expect to be subject to legal\nproceedings and claims, regarding alleged infringement by us and our licensees\nof the trademarks and other intellectual property rights of\n \n                                       11\n<PAGE>   12\n \nthird parties. Such claims, even if not meritorious, may result in the\nexpenditure of significant financial and managerial resources.\n \n     Risks of Year 2000 non-compliance. We have developed a plan to modify our\ninformation technology to recognize the year 2000 and have begun converting our\ncritical data processing systems. We have initiated formal communications with\nour significant suppliers and service providers to determine the extent to which\nour systems may be vulnerable if they fail to address and correct their own Year\n2000 issues. We cannot guarantee that the systems of suppliers or other\ncompanies on which we rely will be Year 2000 compliant. Their failure to convert\ntheir systems could disrupt our systems. In addition, the computer systems\nnecessary to maintain the viability of the Internet or any of the Web sites that\ndirect consumers to our online stores may not be Year 2000 compliant. Finally,\ncomputers used by our customers to access our online stores may not be Year 2000\ncompliant, delaying our customers' purchases of our products. We are in the\nprocess of developing a formal contingency plan. We cannot guarantee that our\nsystems will be Year 2000 compliant or that the Year 2000 problem will not\nadversely affect our business, which includes limiting or precluding customer\npurchases.\n \n     Our stock price is highly volatile. The trading price of our common stock\nfluctuates significantly. For example, during the 52-week period ended February\n28, 1999 (as adjusted for our 2-for-1 split of our common stock effected June 1,\n1998 and 3-for-1 split of our common stock effected January 4, 1999), the\nreported closing price of the common stock on the Nasdaq National Market was as\nhigh as $184 5/8 and as low as $9 1/2 per share. Trading prices of our common\nstock may fluctuate in response to a number of events and factors, such as:\n \n     - quarterly variations in operating results,\n \n     - announcements of innovations,\n \n     - new products, services and strategic developments by us or our\n       competitors,\n \n     - business combinations and investments by us or our competitors,\n \n     - changes in our operating expense levels or losses,\n \n     - changes in financial estimates and recommendations by securities\n       analysts,\n \n     - performance by other online commerce companies, and\n \n     - news reports relating to trends in the Internet, book, music, video or\n       other product or service industries.\n \n     Any of these events may cause our stock price to fall, which may adversely\naffect our business and financing opportunities. In addition, the stock market\nin general and the market prices for Internet-related companies in particular\nhave experienced significant volatility that often has been unrelated to the\noperating performance of such companies. These broad market and industry\nfluctuations may adversely affect the trading price of the common stock,\nregardless of our operating performance.\n \n                                       12\n<PAGE>   13\n \nEXECUTIVE OFFICERS AND DIRECTORS\n \n     The following tables set forth certain information regarding the executive\nofficers and Directors of the Company as of February 28, 1999:\n \nEXECUTIVE OFFICERS\n \n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n                   NAME                      AGE                    POSITION\n                   ----                      ---                    --------\n<S>                                          <C>   <C>\nJeffrey P.

PROPERTIES\n \n     The Company's principal office facilities located in the United States\ncurrently total approximately 150,000 square feet and are located in Seattle,\nWashington under leases that expire in June 1999 through April 2003. The Company\nalso recently leased an office building of approximately 184,000 square feet in\nSeattle, Washington under a lease that expires in 2009. The Company will occupy\nthe office building in 1999. The Company's warehousing and fulfillment\noperations are housed in an approximately 93,000-square-foot facility in\nSeattle, Washington under a lease that expires in October 1999, and in an\napproximately 200,000-square-foot facility located in New Castle, Delaware under\na lease that expires in October 2002. In December 1998, the Company leased an\napproximately 323,000-square-foot distribution facility in Fernley, Nevada under\na lease that expires in 2009. The facility is expected to begin operations in\n1999.\n \n     The Company has additional properties in Europe. The German subsidiary's\nheadquarters and distribution center, located in Regensburg, Germany, total\napproximately 32,000 square feet, under leases that expire in December 1999 and\n2000. The editorial and marketing offices in Germany are approximately 9,000\nsquare feet and are located in Munich under a lease that expires in 2001. The\nheadquarter offices and distribution center of the U.K. subsidiary total\napproximately 41,000 square feet and are located in Slough, England under a\nlease that expires in 2008.\n \n                                       14\n<PAGE>   15\n \n     The Company does not own any real estate as of December 31, 1998.\nAdditionally, the Company anticipates that it will require additional office\nspace within the next 12 months. There can be no assurance that suitable\nadditional space will be available on commercially reasonable terms.\n \n     The Company intends to establish one or more additional distribution\ncenters within the next 12 months, which would require it to commit to lease\nobligations, stock inventories, purchase fixed assets, hire and train employees\nand install leasehold improvements. In addition, the Company has announced plans\nto continue developing distribution infrastructure to increase efficiency and\nsupport greater customer demand, as well as to increase its inventory to provide\nbetter availability to customers and achieve purchasing efficiencies.\n \nITEM 3. LEGAL PROCEEDINGS\n \n     Intimate Bookshop. In August 1998, The Intimate Bookshop and Wallace Kuralt\nfiled a lawsuit in the United States District Court for the Southern District of\nNew York against the Company, Barnes & Noble, Borders Group, Inc. and others\nalleging antitrust, unfair competition and related claims under the\nRobinson-Patman Act, the Clayton Act, the Donnelly Act and certain New York\nstate statutes and common law. The complaint was thereafter amended to drop the\nclass action allegations and certain claims. A claim for unfair competition was\nadded. The plaintiffs requested the following relief: actual damages of\napproximately $11.25 million, treble damages, injunctive relief, punitive\ndamages, pre- and postjudgment interest, attorneys' fees and costs. Amazon.com\nunderstands that the plaintiffs filed a voluntary dismissal of this action, with\nprejudice, on March 4, 1999.\n \n     Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. In October 1998, Wal-Mart Stores, Inc. (\"Wal-Mart\")\nfiled a lawsuit in Bentonville, Arkansas against the Company and other\ndefendants alleging actual and threatened misappropriation of trade secrets and\nancillary common-law claims. Wal-Mart subsequently requested a temporary\nrestraining order preventing the defendants from misappropriating Wal-Mart's\nalleged trade secrets, from placing employees in positions in which they would\n\"inevitably disclose\" Wal-Mart's alleged trade secrets and from soliciting,\ninducing or recruiting Wal-Mart employees. In January 1999, Wal-Mart filed an\nidentical action in Seattle, Washington, and the Arkansas court dismissed\nWal-Mart's action on jurisdictional grounds before deciding the temporary\nrestraining order. The dismissal is pending appeal. Wal-Mart has advised the\nCompany that it will file a preliminary injunction motion. In addition to\ninjunctive relief, Wal-Mart has requested compensatory damages, pre- and\npostjudgment interest and attorneys' fees and costs. The Company believes that\nWal-Mart's claims are without merit and intends to vigorously defend against the\nplaintiffs' claims. Amazon.com has filed a counterclaim based in part on unfair\ncompetition and intentional interference. Litigation is inherently uncertain,\nand there can be no assurance that the Company will prevail in the lawsuit.\n \n     From time to time, the Company is subject to other legal proceedings and\nclaims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged\ninfringement of trademarks and other intellectual property rights. The Company\ncurrently is not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that it believes\nwill have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on its\nbusiness, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n \nITEM 4.

MANAGEMENT'S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS\nOF OPERATIONS\n \nFORWARD-LOOKING STATEMENTS\n \n     This Annual Report on Form 10-K includes forward-looking statements within\nthe meaning of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995. This Act\nprovides a \"safe harbor\" for forward-looking statements to encourage companies\nto provide prospective information about themselves so long as they identify\nthese statements as forward looking and provide meaningful cautionary statements\nidentifying important factors that could cause actual results to differ from the\nprojected results. All statements other than statements of historical fact made\nin this Annual Report on Form 10-K are forward looking. In particular, the\nstatements herein regarding industry prospects and future results of operations\nor financial position are forward-looking statements. Forward-looking statements\nreflect management's current expectations and are inherently uncertain. The\nCompany's actual results may differ significantly from management's\nexpectations. The following discussion and the section entitled\n\"Business -- Additional Factors That May Affect Future Results\" describes some,\nbut not all, of the factors that could cause these differences.\n \nRESULTS OF OPERATIONS\n \n  Net Sales\n \n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n                                  1998      % CHANGE      1997      % CHANGE     1996\n                                --------    --------    --------    --------    -------\n                                                    (IN THOUSANDS)\n<S>                             <C>         <C>         <C>         <C>         <C>\nNet sales.....................  $609,996      313%      $147,787      839%      $15,746\n</TABLE>\n \n     Net sales are composed of the selling price of books, music and other\nproducts and services sold by the Company, net of returns, as well as outbound\nshipping and handling charges. Growth in net sales in 1998 and 1997 reflects a\nsignificant increase in units sold due to the growth of the Company's customer\nbase and repeat purchases from the Company's existing customers. The Company had\napproximately 6.2 million and 1.5 million cumulative customer accounts as of\nDecember 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively. Repeat customer orders accounted for\nover 60% of orders placed on the Amazon.com Web site during the fiscal year\nended December 31, 1998. Additionally, the increase in net sales in 1998 was\npartially due to the opening of the music store in June 1998, the United Kingdom\nand German stores in October 1998 and the video store in November 1998.\n \n     International sales, including export sales from the United States,\nrepresented approximately 20%, 25% and 33% of net sales for the years ended\nDecember 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. Although there can be no\nassurances, the Company does not expect the introduction of the Euro resulting\nfrom the European Monetary Union to significantly impact our competitive\nposition or operations.\n \n  Gross Profit\n \n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n                                    1998      % CHANGE     1997      % CHANGE     1996\n                                  --------    --------    -------    --------    ------\n                                                     (IN THOUSANDS)\n<S>                               <C>         <C>         <C>        <C>         <C>\nGross profit....................  $133,841      364%      $28,818      733%      $3,459\nGross margin....................      21.9%                  19.5%                 22.0%\n</TABLE>\n \n     Gross profit consists of sales less the cost of sales, which consists of\nthe cost of merchandise sold to customers, as well as outbound and inbound\nshipping costs. Gross profit increased in 1998 and 1997 in absolute dollars,\nreflecting the Company's increased sales volume. Gross margin increased in 1998\nas a result of improvements in product costs through improved supply chain\nmanagement, including increased direct purchasing from publishers, which\ntogether more than offset the impact of aggressive product pricing and lower\nmusic and video margins. Gross margin decreased in 1997 due to a combination of\nlower prices and lower overall shipping margins, partially offset by\nimprovements in product cost.\n \n     The Company believes that offering its customers attractive prices is an\nessential component of its business strategy. Accordingly, the Company offers\neveryday discounts of up to 40% on hundreds of\n \n                                       18\n<PAGE>   19\n \nthousands of titles and certain \"special value\" editions discounted up to 85%.\nThe Company may in the future expand or increase the discounts it offers to its\ncustomers and may otherwise alter its pricing structure and policies.\n \n     The Company over time intends to expand its operations by promoting new or\ncomplementary products or sales formats and by expanding the breadth and depth\nof its product and service offerings. Gross margins attributable to new business\nareas may be lower than those associated with the Company's existing business\nactivities. In particular, in June 1998 the Company launched its new music store\nand in November 1998 launched a video store. Music and video gross margins are\nlower than book gross margins. To the extent music and video become a larger\nportion of the Company's product mix, it is expected to have a proportionate\nimpact on overall product gross margin.\n \n  Marketing and Sales\n \n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n                                    1998      % CHANGE     1997      % CHANGE     1996\n                                  --------    --------    -------    --------    ------\n                                                     (IN THOUSANDS)\n<S>                               <C>         <C>         <C>        <C>         <C>\nMarketing and sales.............  $133,023      229%      $40,486      565%      $6,090\nPercentage of net sales.........      21.8%                  27.4%                 38.7%\n</TABLE>\n \n     Marketing and sales expenses consist primarily of advertising, promotional\nand public relations expenditures, as well as payroll and related expenses for\npersonnel engaged in marketing, selling and fulfillment activities. All\nfulfillment costs not included in cost of sales, including the cost of operating\nand staffing distribution centers and customer service, are included in\nmarketing and sales. The Company expects its costs of fulfillment to increase\nbased primarily on anticipated sales growth and its planned distribution network\nexpansion. Marketing and sales expenses increased in 1998 and 1997 primarily due\nto increases in the Company's advertising and promotional expenditures,\nincreased payroll and related costs associated with fulfilling customer demand\nand increased credit card fees resulting from higher sales. The increase in 1998\nwas also attributable to the entry into music and video sales and the launch of\nnew stores in Germany and the United Kingdom. Marketing and sales expenses\ndecreased as a percentage of net sales due to the significant increase in net\nsales. The Company intends to continue to pursue its aggressive branding and\nmarketing campaign, which includes radio, television and print advertising and\nsignificant expenditures for online promotion and advertising relationships. In\naddition, the Company intends to increase investments in marketing, promotion\nand fulfillment activities related to its product, service and international\nexpansion. As a result of the foregoing, the Company expects marketing and sales\nexpenses to increase significantly in absolute dollars.\n \n  Product Development\n \n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n                                    1998      % CHANGE     1997      % CHANGE     1996\n                                   -------    --------    -------    --------    ------\n                                                      (IN THOUSANDS)\n<S>                                <C>        <C>         <C>        <C>         <C>\nProduct development..............  $46,807      236%      $13,916      480%      $2,401\nPercentage of net sales..........      7.7%                   9.4%                 15.2%\n</TABLE>\n \n     Product development expenses consist principally of payroll and related\nexpenses for development, editorial, systems and telecommunications operations\npersonnel and consultants; systems and telecommunications infrastructure; and\ncosts of acquired content, including freelance reviews. The increases in product\ndevelopment expenses in 1998 and 1997 were primarily attributable to increased\nstaffing and costs related to continual feature, content and functionality\nenhancements to the Company's Web sites and transaction-processing systems, as\nwell as increased investment in systems and telecommunications infrastructure.\nSuch increases in 1998 included investments associated with the entry into music\nand video sales, the launch of an enhanced holiday gift store, new stores in\nGermany and the United Kingdom and operating expenses associated with the\nacquired entities. Product development expenses decreased as a percentage of net\nsales due to the significant increase in net sales. To date, product development\ncosts have been expensed as incurred. The Company believes that continued\ninvestment in product development is critical to attaining its strategic\nobjectives. In addition to ongoing investments in its Web stores and\ninfrastructure,\n \n                                       19\n<PAGE>   20\n \nthe Company intends to increase investments in products, services and\ninternational expansion. As a result, the Company expects product development\nexpenses to increase significantly in absolute dollars.\n \n  General and Administrative\n \n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n                                     1998      % CHANGE     1997     % CHANGE     1996\n                                    -------    --------    ------    --------    ------\n                                                      (IN THOUSANDS)\n<S>                                 <C>        <C>         <C>       <C>         <C>\nGeneral and administrative........  $15,799      125%      $7,011      397%      $1,411\nPercentage of net sales...........      2.6%                  4.7%                  9.0%\n</TABLE>\n \n     General and administrative expenses consist of payroll and related expenses\nfor executive, finance and administrative personnel, recruiting, professional\nfees and other general corporate expenses. The 1998 and 1997 increases in\ngeneral and administrative expenses were primarily a result of increased\nsalaries and related expenses associated with the hiring of additional personnel\nand legal and other professional fees related to the Company's growth. In 1998,\nadditional expenses were incurred associated with the acquired entities and the\nrelated international expansion and expanded activities. Beginning in 1997,\ngeneral and administrative costs have included costs attributable to being a\npublic company. General and administrative expenses decreased as a percentage of\nnet sales due to the significant increase in net sales. The Company expects\ngeneral and administrative expenses to increase in absolute dollars as the\nCompany expands its staff and incurs additional costs related to the growth of\nits business, including investments associated with products, services and\ninternational expansion.\n \n  Merger and Acquisition Related Costs, Including Amortization of Goodwill and\nOther Purchased Intangibles\n \n     Merger and acquisition related costs, including amortization of goodwill\nand other purchased intangibles, were approximately $50.2 million or 8.2% of net\nsales in 1998. These costs were recorded in connection with the Company's April\n1998 acquisitions of three Internet companies and its August 1998 acquisition of\nJunglee. These acquisitions were accounted for under the purchase method of\naccounting. Additionally, certain transaction costs were incurred in connection\nwith the August 1998 merger with PlanetAll, which was accounted for under the\npooling of interests method of accounting. Merger and acquisition related costs\nconsist of amortization of goodwill and other purchased intangibles of\napproximately $42.6 million, as well as approximately $7.6 million, composed\nprimarily of equity in loss of investee and other merger and acquisition related\ncosts. The Company anticipates that future amortization of goodwill and other\npurchased intangibles associated with its 1998 acquisitions will continue to be\namortized on a straight-line basis over lives of up to approximately three\nyears, and will amount to approximately $22 million per quarter until March 2000\nand approximately $15 million per quarter thereafter until the related goodwill\nand other purchased intangibles are fully amortized. It is likely that the\nCompany will continue to expand its business through acquisitions and internal\ndevelopment. Any additional acquisitions or impairment of goodwill and other\npurchased intangibles, as well as equity in losses of equity investees, could\nresult in additional merger and acquisition related costs.\n \n  Interest Income and Expense\n \n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n                                       1998      % CHANGE     1997     % CHANGE    1996\n                                      -------    --------    ------    --------    ----\n                                                       (IN THOUSANDS)\n<S>                                   <C>        <C>         <C>       <C>         <C>\nInterest income.....................  $14,053      639%      $1,901      841%      $202\nInterest expense....................

Interest expense in 1998 includes interest and amortization of deferred\ncharges related to the Senior Discount Notes.\n \n     Interest expense in 1998 and 1997 consists of interest and amortization of\ndeferred charges related to the Company's $75 million three-year senior secured\nterm loan (the \"Senior Loan\") entered into in\n \n                                       20\n<PAGE>   21\n \nDecember 1997, as well as asset acquisitions financed through loans and capital\nleases. In 1998, interest expense also includes the write-off of $2.0 million of\nunamortized loan fees following prepayment of the Senior Loan in May 1998.\n \n     The Company expects interest expense to increase in the future as a result\nof the Senior Discount Notes, the Convertible Notes and potentially increased\nfinancing of asset acquisitions through loans and capital leases. The Company\nalso expects interest income to increase because of higher cash balances\nresulting from the net proceeds of the Convertible Notes.\n \n  Income Taxes\n \n     The Company did not provide any current or deferred U.S. federal, state or\nforeign income tax provision or benefit for any of the periods presented because\nit has experienced operating losses since inception. Utilization of the\nCompany's net operating loss carryforwards, which begin to expire in 2011, may\nbe subject to certain limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code\nof 1986, as amended. The Company has provided a full valuation allowance on the\ndeferred tax asset, consisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards,\nbecause of uncertainty regarding its realizability.\n \nPRO FORMA INFORMATION\n \n     In April 1998, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of\nthree Internet companies. Each of the acquisitions was accounted for under the\npurchase method of accounting. The aggregate purchase price of the three\nacquisitions, plus related charges, was approximately $55 million. The\nconsideration for the acquisitions was comprised of common stock and cash. The\nCompany issued an aggregate of approximately 3.2 million shares of common stock\nto affect the transactions. The Company is amortizing the goodwill resulting\nfrom the acquisitions on a straight-line basis over approximately two years.\n \n     In August 1998, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock\nof Junglee. The Company issued approximately 4.7 million shares of common stock\nand assumed all outstanding options and warrants in connection with the\nacquisition of Junglee. The Junglee acquisition was accounted for under the\npurchase method of accounting, with substantially all of the approximately $180\nmillion purchase price allocated to goodwill and other purchased intangibles.\nThe goodwill and substantially all other purchased intangible assets are being\namortized on a straight-line basis over lives averaging approximately three\nyears.\n \n     In August 1998, the Company exchanged common stock and options for all of\nthe outstanding capital stock of PlanetAll. The Company issued approximately 2.4\nmillion shares of common stock and assumed all outstanding options in connection\nwith the merger. The PlanetAll merger was accounted for as a pooling of\ninterests and, as a result, the Company's consolidated financial statements have\nbeen restated for all periods presented.\n \n     As of December 31, 1998, the Company has an investment of approximately 46%\nin drugstore.com, inc., an online drugstore, that is accounted for under the\nequity method of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, the\nCompany's share of the investee's earnings or loss is included in consolidated\noperating results. The Company's basis in its equity investment is classified\nwithin other purchased intangibles in the accompanying consolidated balance\nsheet and the Company's share of the investee's loss is classified in merger and\nacquisition related costs, including amortization of goodwill and other\npurchased intangibles. To date, this investment has not materially impacted the\nCompany's results of operations or its financial position.\n \n     Pro forma information regarding the Company's results, excluding\napproximately $50.2 million of merger and acquisition related costs, which\ninclude amortization of goodwill and other purchased\n \n                                       21\n<PAGE>   22\n \nintangibles, for the business combinations discussed above, as well as the\nCompany's share of losses from its investee, is as follows:\n \n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n                                                                YEAR ENDED\n                                                               DECEMBER 31,\n                                                                   1998\n                                                              --------------\n                                                              (IN THOUSANDS)\n<S>                                                           <C>\nPro forma loss from operations..............................     $(61,788)\nPro forma net loss..........................................     $(74,374)\nPro forma basic and diluted loss per share..................     $  (0.50)\nShares used in computation of basic and diluted loss per\n  share.....................................................      148,172\n</TABLE>\n \n     The pro forma results for the year ended December 31, 1998 are presented\nfor informational purposes only and are not prepared in accordance with\ngenerally accepted accounting principles.\n \nLIQUIDITY AND CAPITAL RESOURCES\n \n     At December 31, 1998, the Company's cash was $25.6 million, compared to\n$1.9 million at December 31, 1997. Marketable securities balances, which include\nhighly liquid investments with maturities of three months or less, were $347.9\nmillion and $123.5 million at December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively.\n \n     Net cash provided by operating activities of $31.0 million and $687,000 for\nthe years ended December 31, 1998 and 1997, respectively, was primarily\nattributable to increases in accounts payable, other liabilities and accrued\nexpenses, accrued advertising and non-cash expenses, largely offset by the net\nloss and increases in inventories and prepaid expenses and other.\n \n     Net cash used in investing activities was $261.8 million for the year ended\nDecember 31, 1998 and consisted of net purchases of marketable securities,\npurchases of fixed assets, and acquisitions, dispositions and investments in\nbusinesses. For the year ended December 31, 1997, net cash used in investing\nactivities was $125.7 million and consisted of net purchases of marketable\nsecurities and purchases of fixed assets.\n \n     Net cash provided by financing activities of $254.5 million for the year\nended December 31, 1998 resulted from net proceeds of approximately $318.2\nmillion from the Senior Discount Notes offering, net proceeds of approximately\n$8.4 million from PlanetAll's issuance of capital stock, and proceeds from the\nexercise of stock options of $6.0 million, partially offset by the repayment of\nthe Senior Loan. Net cash provided by financing activities of $126.0 million for\nthe year ended December 31, 1997 resulted primarily from net proceeds from the\nSenior Loan, the Company's initial public offering and PlanetAll's issuance of\ncapital stock.\n \n     As of December 31, 1998, the Company's principal sources of liquidity\nconsisted of $373.4 million of cash and marketable securities. As of that date,\nthe Company's principal commitments consisted of obligations outstanding under\nits Senior Discount Notes, obligations in connection with the acquisition of\nfixed assets, operating leases and commitments for advertising and promotional\narrangements. The Company anticipates a substantial increase in its capital\nexpenditures and lease commitments consistent with anticipated growth in\noperations, infrastructure and personnel, including growth associated with\nproduct and service offerings, geographic expansion and integration of business\ncombinations. For example, in August 1998, the Company entered into a long-term\noffice lease, which will result in increased lease obligations commencing in\n1999, and, in December 1998, the Company leased a highly mechanized distribution\nfacility in Fernley, Nevada, which is expected to begin operations in 1999.\nBringing these facilities to operational readiness will require significant\nleasehold improvement and capital expenditures, and require the Company to stock\ninventories, purchase fixed assets and hire and train employees.\n \n     The Company intends to establish one or more additional distribution\ncenters within the next 12 months, which would require it to commit to lease\nobligations, stock inventories, purchase fixed assets, hire and train employees\nand install leasehold improvements. In addition, the Company has announced plans\nto continue developing distribution infrastructure to increase efficiency and\nsupport greater customer\n \n                                       22\n<PAGE>   23\n \ndemand and to increase its inventory to provide better availability to customers\nand achieve purchasing efficiencies.\n \n  Senior Discount Notes\n \n     In May 1998, the Company completed the offering of approximately $326\nmillion gross proceeds of the Senior Discount Notes. Pursuant to a registration\nstatement on Form S-4, in September 1998, the Company completed an exchange\noffer of 10% Senior Discount Notes due 2008 (the \"Exchange Notes\"), which were\nregistered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended (the \"Securities Act\"),\nfor all outstanding Senior Discount Notes. The Exchange Notes have identical\nterms in all material respects to the terms of the original Senior Discount\nNotes, except that the Exchange Notes generally are freely transferable (the\nExchange Notes are referred to throughout this Annual Report interchangeably\nwith the Senior Discount Notes). The Exchange Notes were issued under the\nindenture governing the original Senior Discount Notes (the \"Senior Notes\nIndenture\"). The Senior Discount Notes were sold at a substantial discount from\ntheir principal amount at maturity of $530 million. Prior to November 1, 2003,\nno cash interest payments are required; instead, interest will accrete during\nthis period to the $530 million aggregate principal amount at maturity. From and\nafter May 1, 2003, the Senior Discount Notes will bear interest at the rate of\n10% per annum payable in cash on each May 1 and November 1. The Senior Discount\nNotes are redeemable, at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at any\ntime on or after May 1, 2003, at the redemption prices set forth in the Senior\nNotes Indenture, plus accrued interest, if any, to the date of redemption.\n \n     Upon a Change of Control (as defined in the Senior Notes Indenture), the\nCompany would be required to make an offer to purchase the Senior Discount Notes\nat a purchase price equal to 101% of their Accreted Value on the date of\npurchase, plus accrued interest, if any. There can be no assurance that the\nCompany would have sufficient funds available at the time of any Change of\nControl to make any required debt repayment (including repurchases of the Senior\nDiscount Notes).\n \n     The Senior Notes Indenture contains certain covenants that, among other\nthings, limit the ability of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (as\ndefined in the Senior Notes Indenture) to incur indebtedness, pay dividends,\nprepay subordinated indebtedness, repurchase capital stock, make investments,\ncreate liens, engage in transactions with stockholders and affiliates, sell\nassets and engage in mergers and consolidations. However, these limitations are\nsubject to a number of important qualifications and exceptions. The Company was\nin compliance with all financial covenants at December 31, 1998.\n \n  Convertible Subordinated Notes\n \n     In February 1999, the Company completed an offering of approximately $1.25\nbillion of the Convertible Notes. Interest payments on the Convertible Notes of\n4 3/4% per annum are due and payable semiannually in arrears in cash on February\n1 and August 1 of each year, commencing August 1, 1999. The Convertible Notes\nare unsecured and are subordinated to all existing and future Senior\nIndebtedness as defined in the indenture governing the Convertible Notes (the\n\"Convertible Notes Indenture\"). The Convertible Notes are generally convertible\ninto common stock of the Company, unless redeemed or repaid prior to maturity,\nat a conversion price of $156.055 per share. The Convertible Notes may be\nredeemed by the Company (the \"Provisional Redemption\"), in whole or in part, at\nany time prior to February 6, 2002, at a redemption price equal to $1,000 per\nConvertible Note to be redeemed plus accrued and unpaid interest, if any, to the\ndate of redemption (the \"Provisional Redemption Date\") if (1) the closing price\nof the common stock shall have exceeded 150% of the conversion price then in\neffect for at least 20 trading days in any consecutive 30-trading day period and\n(2) the shelf registration statement covering resales of the Convertible Notes\nand the common stock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes is\neffective and available for use and is expected to remain effective and\navailable for use for the 30 days following the Provisional Redemption Date.\nUpon any Provisional Redemption, the Company will make an additional payment in\ncash with respect to the Convertible Notes called for redemption in an amount\nequal to $212.60 per $1,000 Convertible Note, less the amount of any interest\nactually paid on such Convertible Note prior to the call for redemption. The\nCompany must make these\n                                       23\n<PAGE>   24\n \npayments on all of the Convertible Notes called for redemption, including\nConvertible Notes called after the date of the call for redemption. After\nFebruary 6, 2002, the Convertible Notes will be redeemable on at least 30 days'\nnotice at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at any time, at the\nredemption prices set forth in the Convertible Notes Indenture.\n \n     Upon occurrence of any Fundamental Change (as defined in the Convertible\nNotes Indenture) prior to the maturity of the Convertible Notes, each holder of\nthe Convertible Notes has the right to require the Company to redeem all or any\npart of the holder's Convertible Notes at a price equal to 100% of the principal\namount, plus any accrued interest, of the Convertible Notes being redeemed.\n \n     The Company will, for the benefit of the holders, file with the Securities\nand Exchange Commission as soon as practicable, but in any event within 90 days\nafter the first date of original issuance of the Convertible Notes, a shelf\nregistration statement covering resales of the Convertible Notes and the common\nstock issuable upon conversion of the Convertible Notes.\n \n     The Company has or may use the net proceeds from the offering of the\nConvertible Notes for general corporate purposes, including working capital to\nfund anticipated operating losses, the expansion of the Company's core business,\ninvestments in new business segments and markets, capital expenditures,\nacquisitions or investments in complementary businesses, products and\ntechnologies and repurchases and retirement of debt.\n \n     The Company believes that current cash and marketable securities balances,\ntogether with net proceeds from the Convertible Notes, will be sufficient to\nmeet its anticipated cash needs for at least the next 12 months. However, any\nprojections of future cash needs and cash flows are subject to substantial\nuncertainty. If current cash, marketable securities and cash that may be\ngenerated from operations are insufficient to satisfy the Company's liquidity\nrequirements, the Company may seek to sell additional equity or debt securities\nor to obtain a line of credit. The sale of additional equity or convertible debt\nsecurities could result in additional dilution to the Company's stockholders. In\naddition, the Company will, from time to time, consider the acquisition of or\ninvestment in complementary businesses, products, services and technologies, and\nthe repurchase and retirement of debt, which might impact the Company's\nliquidity requirements or cause the Company to issue additional equity or debt\nsecurities. There can be no assurance that financing will be available in\namounts or on terms acceptable to the Company, if at all.\n \nYEAR 2000 IMPLICATIONS\n \n     Many current installed computer systems and software may be coded to accept\nonly two-digit entries in the date code field and cannot distinguish 21st\ncentury dates from 20th century dates. As a result, many software and computer\nsystems may need to be upgraded or replaced. The Company is in the process of\nassessing the Year 2000 issue and expects to complete the program in the second\nquarter of 1999. The Company has not incurred material costs to date in the\nprocess, and does not believe that the cost of additional actions will have a\nmaterial effect on its operating results or financial condition. However, the\nCompany has established a budget totaling approximately $1 million for the\nacquisition of contract software services that will assist in the Year 2000\nassessment and remediation activities to be completed no later than the third\nquarter of 1999. Amazon.com's current systems and products may contain\nundetected errors or defects with Year 2000 date functions that may result in\nmaterial costs. In addition, the Company utilizes third-party equipment,\nsoftware and content, including non-information technology systems, such as\nsecurity systems, building equipment and embedded micro-controllers that may not\nbe Year 2000 compliant. The Company is in the process of developing a plan to\nassess whether its internally developed software, third-party systems and\nnon-information technology systems are adequately addressing the Year 2000\nissue. Failure of third-party equipment, software or content to operate properly\nwith regard to the Year 2000 issue could require the Company to incur\nunanticipated expenses to remedy problems, which could have a material adverse\neffect on its business, operating results and financial condition.\n \n     Amazon.com is assessing whether third parties in its supply and\ndistribution chain are adequately addressing their Year 2000 compliance issues.\nThe Company has initiated formal communications with its significant suppliers\nand service providers to determine the extent to which its systems may be\nvulnerable\n                                       24\n<PAGE>   25\n \nif such suppliers and providers fail to address and correct their own Year 2000\nissues. The Company cannot guarantee that the systems of suppliers or other\ncompanies on which the Company relies will be Year 2000 compliant. The Company\nis in the process of developing a contingency plan that will address situations\nthat may result should Year 2000 compliance for critical operations not be fully\nachieved in 1999.\n \nITEM 7A. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURE ABOUT MARKET RISK\n \n     The Company does not have any derivative financial instruments as of\nDecember 31, 1998. However, the Company is exposed to interest rate risk.

(\"Amazon.com\" or the \"Company\"), an Internet retailer, was\nincorporated in July 1994 and opened its virtual doors on the Web in July 1995.\nAmazon.com offers book, music CD, video, DVD, computer game and other titles on\nits Web sites.\n \n  Business Combinations and Investments\n \n     For business combinations which have been accounted for under the purchase\nmethod of accounting, the Company includes the results of operations of the\nacquired business from the date of acquisition. Net assets of the companies\nacquired are recorded at their fair value at the date of acquisition. The excess\nof the purchase price over the fair value of net assets acquired is included in\ngoodwill and other purchased intangibles in the accompanying consolidated\nbalance sheets.\n \n     Other business combinations are accounted for under the pooling of\ninterests method of accounting. In such cases, the assets, liabilities and\nstockholders' equity of the acquired entities are combined with the Company's\nrespective accounts at recorded values. The consolidated financial statements\nreflect the restatement of all periods presented to include the accounts of\nmerged entities accounted for under the pooling of interests method of\naccounting. The historical results of the pooled entities reflect each of their\nactual operating cost structures and, as a result, do not necessarily reflect\nthe cost structure of the newly combined entity. The historical results do not\npurport to be indicative of future results.\n \n     Investments in affiliated entities in which the Company has the ability to\nexercise significant influence of an investee, generally a 20% or greater\nownership interest of the voting stock, are accounted for under the equity\nmethod of accounting. Under the equity method of accounting, the Company's share\nof the investee's earnings or loss is included in consolidated operating\nresults.\n \n     All other investments, for which the Company does not have the ability to\nexercise significant influence, are accounted for under the cost method of\naccounting. Dividends and other distributions of earnings from other investees,\nif any, are included in income when declared. The Company periodically evaluates\nthe carrying value of its investments accounted for under the cost method of\naccounting and as of December 31, 1998, such investments were recorded at the\nlower of cost or estimated net realizable value.\n \n  Principles of Consolidation\n \n     The consolidated financial statements include the accounts of the Company\nand its wholly owned subsidiaries. All significant intercompany balances and\ntransactions have been eliminated.\n \n  Use of Estimates\n \n     The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally\naccepted accounting principles requires management to make estimates and\nassumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and\ndisclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the financial\nstatements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the\nreporting period. Actual results could differ from those estimates.\n \n  Marketable Securities\n \n     The Company's marketable securities consist primarily of high-quality\nshort- to intermediate-term fixed income securities and money market mutual\nfunds, are classified as available-for-sale and are reported at fair value.\nUnrealized gains and losses are reported, net of taxes, as a component of\n                                       32\n<PAGE>   33\n                                AMAZON.COM, INC.\n \n             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n \nstockholders' equity within accumulated other comprehensive income. Unrealized\nlosses are charged against income when a decline in fair value is determined to\nbe other than temporary. The specific identification method is used to determine\nthe cost of securities sold. The Company classifies all investments of cash as\nmarketable securities, including highly liquid investments with maturities of\nthree months or less, and reflects the related cash flows as investing cash\nflows. As a result of the classification of highly liquid investments within\nmarketable securities, a significant portion of the Company's gross marketable\nsecurities purchases and maturities disclosed as investing cash flows is related\nto highly liquid investments.\n \n  Inventories\n \n     Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or market. The Company\npurchases a majority of its products from three major vendors, Ingram Book Group\n(\"Ingram\"), Baker & Taylor, Inc. and Valley Media Inc. In late 1998, Barnes &\nNoble announced an agreement to purchase Ingram. Ingram is the Company's single\nlargest supplier and accounted for approximately 40% and approximately 60% of\nthe Company's inventory purchases in 1998 and 1997, respectively. The Company\ndoes not have long-term contracts or arrangements with most of its vendors to\nguarantee the availability of merchandise, particular payment terms or the\nextension of credit limits. The Company's current vendors may stop selling\nmerchandise to the Company on acceptable terms. The Company may not be able to\nacquire merchandise from other suppliers in a timely and efficient manner and on\nacceptable terms.\n \n  Fixed Assets\n \n     Fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and\namortization, which includes the amortization of assets recorded under capital\nleases. Fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the estimated\nuseful lives of the assets (generally one to ten years). Fixed assets purchased\nunder capital leases are amortized on a straight-line basis over the lesser of\nthe estimated useful life of the asset or the lease term.\n \n  Goodwill and Other Purchased Intangibles\n \n     Goodwill and other purchased intangibles represent the excess of the\npurchase price over the fair value of assets acquired. Total goodwill of\napproximately $215.7 million and other purchased intangibles of approximately\n$13.3 million are stated net of total accumulated amortization of $42.6 million\nat December 31, 1998 in the accompanying balance sheet. Goodwill and\nsubstantially all other purchased intangibles are being amortized on a\nstraight-line basis over lives ranging from two to three years.\n \n  Long-Lived Assets\n \n     In accordance with Financial Accounting Standards Board (\"FASB\") Statement\nof Financial Accounting Standard (\"SFAS\") No. 121, Accounting for the Impairment\nof Long-Lived Assets and for Long-Lived Assets to be Disposed Of, the carrying\nvalue of intangible assets and other long-lived assets is reviewed on a regular\nbasis for the existence of facts or circumstances, both internally and\nexternally, that may suggest impairment. To date, no such impairment has been\nindicated. Should there be an impairment in the future, the Company will measure\nthe amount of the impairment based on undiscounted expected future cash flows\nfrom the impaired assets. The cash flow estimates that will be used will contain\nmanagement's best estimates, using appropriate and customary assumptions and\nprojections at the time.\n \n  Fair Value of Financial Instruments\n \n     The carrying amounts for the Company's cash, prepaid expenses and other,\ndeposits and other, accounts payable, accrued advertising, and other liabilities\nand accrued expenses approximate fair value.\n \n                                       33\n<PAGE>   34\n                                AMAZON.COM, INC.\n \n             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n \nThe fair market value for long-term debt and marketable securities is based on\nquoted market prices where available.\n \n  Deferred Charges\n \n     In May 1998, the Company issued approximately $326 million gross proceeds\nof 10% Senior Discount Notes due 2008 (the \"Senior Discount Notes\"). At December\n31, 1998, deferred charges consisted of fees associated with the issuance of the\nSenior Discount Notes. The fees are being amortized into interest expense over\nthe life of the Senior Discount Notes.\n \n  Income Taxes\n \n     The Company recognizes deferred tax assets and liabilities based on\ndifferences between the financial reporting and tax bases of assets and\nliabilities using the enacted tax rates and laws that are expected to be in\neffect when the differences are expected to be recovered.\n \n  Revenue Recognition\n \n     The Company recognizes revenue from product sales, net of any discounts,\nwhen the products are shipped to customers. Outbound shipping and handling\ncharges are included in net sales. Revenue from gift certificates is recognized\nupon product shipment following redemption. The Company provides an allowance\nfor sales returns, which has been insignificant, based on historical experience.\n \n  Advertising Costs\n \n     The cost of advertising is expensed as incurred. For the years ended\nDecember 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, the Company incurred advertising expense of\n$60.2 million, $21.2 million and $3.4 million, respectively.\n \n  Product Development\n \n     Product development expenses consist principally of payroll and related\nexpenses for development, editorial, systems and telecommunications operations\npersonnel and consultants, systems and telecommunications infrastructure and\ncosts of acquired content. To date, all product development costs have been\nexpensed as incurred.\n \n  Merger and Acquisition Related Costs\n \n     Merger and acquisition related costs consist primarily of amortization of\ngoodwill and other purchased intangibles of approximately $42.6 million, as well\nas approximately $7.6 million, composed primarily of equity in loss of investee\nand other merger and acquisition related costs.\n \n  Stock-Based Compensation\n \n     The Company has elected to follow Accounting Principles Board Opinion No.\n25, Accounting for Stock Issued to Employees (\"APB No. 25\"), and related\ninterpretations, in accounting for its employee stock options rather than the\nalternative fair value accounting allowed by SFAS No. 123, Accounting for\nStock-Based Compensation. APB No. 25 provides that the compensation expense\nrelative to the Company's employee stock options is measured based on the\nintrinsic value of the stock option. SFAS No. 123 requires companies that\ncontinue to follow APB No. 25 to provide a pro forma disclosure of the impact of\napplying the fair value method of SFAS No. 123.\n \n                                       34\n<PAGE>   35\n                                AMAZON.COM, INC.\n \n             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n \n  Foreign Currency Translation\n \n     The functional currency of the Company's foreign subsidiaries is the local\ncurrency. Assets and liabilities of the foreign subsidiaries are translated into\nU.S. dollars at year end exchange rates, and revenues and expenses are\ntranslated at average rates prevailing during the year. Translation adjustments\nare included in accumulated other comprehensive income, a separate component of\nstockholders' equity. Transaction gains and losses arising from transactions\ndenominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the entity\ninvolved, which have been insignificant, are included in the consolidated\nstatements of operations. To date, the Company has entered into no foreign\ncurrency exchange contracts or other such derivative instruments.\n \n  Segment and Geographic Information\n \n     The Company operates in one principal business segment across domestic and\ninternational markets. International sales, including export sales from the\nUnited States, represented approximately 20%, 25%, and 33% of net sales for the\nyears ended December 31, 1998, 1997 and 1996, respectively. No foreign country\nor geographic area accounted for more than 10% of net sales in any of the\nperiods presented. There were no transfers between geographic areas during the\nyears ended December 31, 1998 and 1997. Substantially all of the domestic\noperating results and identifiable assets are in the United States.\n \n  Concentrations of Credit Risk\n \n     Financial instruments, which potentially subject the Company to\nconcentrations of credit risk, consist principally of its holdings of cash and\nmarketable securities. The Company's credit risk is managed by investing its\ncash and marketable securities in high-quality money market instruments and\nsecurities of the U.S. government and its agencies, foreign governments and\nhigh-quality corporate issuers. At December 31, 1998, the Company has no\nsignificant concentrations of credit risk.\n \n  Earnings (Loss) Per Share\n \n     Basic earnings per share excludes any dilutive effects of options, warrants\nand convertible securities. Basic earnings per share is computed using the\nweighted-average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted\nearnings per share is computed using the weighted-average number of common and\ncommon stock equivalent shares outstanding during the period. Common equivalent\nshares are excluded from the computation if their effect is antidilutive.\n \n     As a result of the Company's initial public offering in May 1997, all\npreferred stock automatically converted into common stock. Accordingly, the 1997\nand 1996 net loss per share is a pro forma loss per share based on the weighted\naverage number of shares of common stock outstanding and preferred stock on an\n\"as if\" converted basis outstanding during each period. The Company believes\nthat this is a more meaningful presentation of earnings per share for periods\nprior to its initial public offering.\n \n  Comprehensive Income (Loss)\n \n     As of January 1, 1998, the Company adopted SFAS No. 130, Reporting\nComprehensive Income, which establishes standards for the reporting and display\nof comprehensive income and its components in the financial statements. The only\nitems of comprehensive income (loss) that the Company currently reports are\nunrealized gains (losses) on marketable securities and foreign currency\ntranslation adjustments.\n \n  New Accounting Pronouncements\n \n     In March 1998, the Accounting Standards Executive Committee issued\nStatement of Position 98-1 (\"SOP 98-1\"), Accounting for the Costs of Computer\nSoftware Developed or Obtained for Internal Use.\n \n                                       35\n<PAGE>   36\n                                AMAZON.COM, INC.\n \n             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n \nSOP 98-1 requires all costs related to the development of internal use software\nother than those incurred during the application development stage to be\nexpensed as incurred. Costs incurred during the application development stage\nare required to be capitalized and amortized over the estimated useful life of\nthe software. SOP 98-1 is effective for the Company's fiscal year ending\nDecember 31, 1999. Adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the\nCompany's consolidated financial statements as the Company's policies are\nsubstantially in compliance with SOP 98-1.\n \n     In April 1998, the American Institute of Certified Public Accountants\nissued SOP 98-5, Reporting on the Costs of Start-Up Activities. SOP 98-5 is\neffective for the Company's fiscal year ending December 31, 1999. SOP 98-5\nrequires costs of start-up activities and organization costs to be expensed as\nincurred. Adoption is not expected to have a material effect on the Company's\nconsolidated financial statements.\n \n     In June 1998, the FASB issued SFAS No. 133 Accounting for Derivative\nInstruments and Hedging Activities. SFAS No. 133 is effective for fiscal years\nbeginning after June 15, 1999. SFAS No. 133 requires that all derivative\ninstruments be recorded on the balance sheet at their fair value. Changes in the\nfair value of derivatives are recorded each period in current earnings or other\ncomprehensive income, depending on whether a derivative is designed as part of a\nhedge transaction and, if it is, the type of hedge transaction. The Company does\nnot expect that the adoption of SFAS No. 133 will have a material impact on its\nconsolidated financial statements because the Company does not currently hold\nany derivative instruments.\n \n  Reclassifications\n \n     Certain prior year balances have been reclassified to conform to the\ncurrent year presentation.\n \nNOTE 2 -- BUSINESS COMBINATIONS AND INVESTMENTS\n \n     In April 1998, the Company acquired all of the outstanding capital stock of\nthree international Internet companies. The aggregate purchase price of the\nthree acquisitions, plus related charges, was approximately $55 million. The\nconsideration for the acquisitions was comprised of common stock and cash. The\nCompany issued an aggregate of approximately 3.2 million shares of common stock\nto effect the transactions. The goodwill and other purchased intangibles are\nbeing amortized on a straight-line basis over two years.\n \n     In August 1998, the Company acquired all the outstanding capital stock of\nJunglee Corp. (\"Junglee\"). Junglee is a leading provider of Web-based virtual\ndatabase technology which allows visitors to access a variety of products sold\nby other merchants. The Company issued approximately 4.7 million shares of\ncommon stock and assumed all outstanding options and warrants in connection with\nthe acquisition of Junglee. The Junglee acquisition was accounted for under the\npurchase method of accounting, with substantially all of the approximately $180\nmillion purchase price allocated to goodwill and other purchased intangibles.\nThe goodwill and substantially all other purchased intangible assets are being\namortized on a straight-line basis over lives averaging approximately three\nyears. In November 1998, the Company sold the employment business unit of\nJunglee in exchange for cash and approximately 1.7 million shares of the\npurchaser's common stock. There was no gain or loss recorded from this sale. The\ninvestment is recorded at cost and is classified within marketable securities in\nthe accompanying consolidated balance sheet.\n \n     The pro forma combined consolidated financial information for the aggregate\nof all the business combinations described above and accounted for under the\npurchase method of accounting, as though the acquisitions had occurred on\nJanuary 1 of each year, would have resulted in net sales of $615.0 million and\n$155.8 million; net loss of $171.6 million and $118.7 million; and basic and\ndiluted loss per share of $1.12 and $0.86 for the years ended December 31, 1998\nand 1997, respectively. The pro forma net loss includes amortization of goodwill\nand purchased intangibles of $83.0 million for the years ended December 31,\n                                       36\n<PAGE>   37\n                                AMAZON.COM, INC.\n \n             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n \n1998 and 1997. This unaudited pro forma combined consolidated financial\ninformation is presented for illustrative purposes only and is not necessarily\nindicative of the consolidated results of operations in future periods or the\nresults that actually would have been realized had Amazon.com, the international\nsubsidiaries and Junglee been a combined company during the specified periods.\n \n     In August 1998, the Company exchanged common stock and options for all of\nthe outstanding capital stock of Sage Enterprises, Inc. (\"PlanetAll\"). The\nCompany issued approximately 2.4 million shares of common stock and assumed all\noutstanding options in connection with the merger. The PlanetAll merger was\naccounted for as a pooling of interests and, as a result, the Company's\nconsolidated financial statements have been restated for all periods presented.\nPlanetAll issued approximately 167,000 shares of capital stock for proceeds of\napproximately $1.0 million and approximately 896,000 shares of capital stock for\nproceeds of approximately $7.4 million in January 1998 and April 1998,\nrespectively.\n \n     Net sales for PlanetAll were not significant and net loss was $4.1 million,\n$3.4 million and $469,000 for the nine months ended September 30, 1998 and the\nyears ended December 31, 1997 and 1996, respectively, which represent separate\nresults of the combined entity through the periods preceding the merger.

Pursuant to\na registration statement on Form S-4 in September 1998, the Company completed an\nexchange offer of 10% Senior Discount Notes due 2008 (the \"Exchange Notes\"),\nwhich were registered under the Securities Act of 1933, as amended, for all\noutstanding Senior Discount Notes. The Exchange Notes have identical terms in\nall material respects to the terms of the original Senior Discount Notes, except\nthat the Exchange Notes generally are freely transferable (the Exchange Notes\nare referred to throughout these notes to consolidated financial statements\ninterchangeably with the Senior Discount Notes). The Exchange Notes were issued\nunder the indenture governing the original Senior Discount Notes (the\n\"Indenture\"). The Senior Discount Notes were sold at a substantial discount from\ntheir principal amount at maturity of $530 million. Prior to November 1, 2003,\nno cash interest payments are required; instead, interest will accrete during\nthis period to the $530 million aggregate principal amount at maturity. From and\nafter May 1, 2003, the Senior Discount Notes will bear interest at a rate of 10%\nper annum payable in cash on each May 1 and November 1. The Senior Discount\nNotes are redeemable, at the option of the Company, in whole or in part, at any\ntime on or after May 1, 2003, at the redemption prices set forth in the\nIndenture, plus accrued interest, if any, to the date of redemption.\n \n     The Senior Discount Notes are senior unsecured indebtedness of the Company\nranking pari passu with the Company's existing and future unsubordinated,\nunsecured indebtedness and senior in right of payment to all subordinated\nindebtedness of the Company. The Senior Discount Notes are effectively\nsubordinated to all secured indebtedness and to all existing and future\nliabilities of the Company's subsidiaries.\n \n                                       38\n<PAGE>   39\n                                AMAZON.COM, INC.\n \n             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n \n     The Indenture contains certain covenants that, among other things, limit\nthe ability of the Company and its Restricted Subsidiaries (as defined in the\nIndenture) to incur indebtedness, pay dividends, prepay subordinated\nindebtedness, repurchase capital stock, make investments, create liens, engage\nin transactions with stockholders and affiliates, sell assets and engage in\nmergers and consolidations. However, these limitations are subject to a number\nof important qualifications and exceptions. The Company was in compliance with\nall financial covenants at December 31, 1998.\n \n     A portion of the net proceeds from the offering of the Senior Discount\nNotes was used to retire approximately $75 million of indebtedness outstanding\nas of December 31, 1997. Future principal payments related to the Senior\nDiscount Notes do not commence until 2008. The carrying amount of the Senior\nDiscount Notes is approximately $347.2 million as of December 31, 1998, which\napproximates fair value.\n \n  Financing Agreement for Purchase of Fixed Assets\n \n     In November 1997, the Company purchased fixed assets through a financing\nagreement with a vendor having an imputed interest rate of approximately 7.7%\nand a term of three years. The debt is to be repaid in four equal payments.\nFuture debt payments related to this financing agreement are $684,000 and\n$837,000 for the years ending December 31, 1999 and 2000, respectively, and none\nthereafter.\n \nNOTE 6 -- COMMITMENTS AND CONTINGENCIES\n \n  Leases and Marketing Agreements\n \n     The Company currently leases office and distribution center facilities and\nfixed assets under noncancelable operating and capital leases. Rental expense\nunder operating lease agreements for 1998, 1997 and 1996 was $8.5 million, $2.1\nmillion and $270,000, respectively.\n \n     The Company has also entered into certain marketing agreements, which\ninclude fixed fees through 2000.

(\"Wal-Mart\") filed a lawsuit in\nBentonville, Arkansas against the Company and other defendants alleging actual\nand threatened misappropriation of trade secrets and ancillary common-law\nclaims. Wal-Mart subsequently requested a temporary restraining order preventing\nthe defendants from misappropriating Wal-Mart's alleged trade secrets, from\nplacing employees in positions in which they would \"inevitably disclose\"\nWal-Mart's alleged trade secrets and from soliciting, inducing or recruiting\nWal-Mart employees. In January 1999, Wal-Mart filed an identical action in\nSeattle, Washington, and the Arkansas court dismissed Wal-Mart's action on\njurisdictional grounds before deciding the temporary restraining order. The\ndismissal is pending appeal. Wal-Mart has advised the Company that it will file\na preliminary injunction motion. In addition to injunctive relief, Wal-Mart has\nrequested compensatory damages, pre- and postjudgment interest and attorneys'\nfees and costs. The Company believes that Wal-Mart's claims are without merit\nand intends to vigorously defend against the plaintiffs' claims. Amazon.com has\nfiled a counterclaim based in part on unfair competition and intentional\ninterference. Litigation is inherently uncertain, and there can be no assurance\nthat the Company will prevail in the lawsuit.\n \n     From time to time, the Company is subject to other legal proceedings and\nclaims in the ordinary course of business, including claims of alleged\ninfringement of trademarks and other intellectual property rights. The Company\ncurrently is not aware of any such legal proceedings or claims that it believes\nwill have, individually or in the aggregate, a material adverse effect on its\nbusiness, prospects, financial condition and operating results.\n \nNOTE 7 -- STOCKHOLDERS' EQUITY\n \n  Reincorporation and Authorized Capital\n \n     In May 1996, the Company reincorporated in the state of Delaware with\nauthorized capital of 5 million shares of $0.01 par value preferred stock and 25\nmillion shares of $0.01 par value common stock. In April 1997, the Company\nincreased its authorized common stock to 100 million shares and increased its\nauthorized preferred stock to 10 million shares. In June 1998, the Company\nincreased the number of authorized shares of common stock, from 100 million\nshares to 300 million shares. The accompanying consolidated financial statements\nhave been restated to reflect these recapitalizations.\n \n  Preferred Stock\n \n     In June 1996, the Company issued 569,396 shares of Series A convertible\npreferred stock at a price of $14.05 per share. In January and February 1997,\nthe Company sold an additional 5,000 shares of Series A preferred stock at $40\nper share. The preferred stock was convertible into common stock at the option\nof the holder, at any time, at an effective rate of 36 shares of common stock\nfor one share of preferred stock. As of the closing of the Company's initial\npublic offering, all of the preferred stock outstanding was converted into an\naggregate of 20,678,256 shares of common stock.\n \n  Common Stock\n \n     On November 23, 1996, the Company effected a 4-for-1 common stock split. On\nApril 18, 1997, the Company effected a 3-for-2 common stock split. On May 15,\n1997, the Company completed an initial public offering of 18 million shares of\nits common stock. Net proceeds to the Company aggregated $49.1 million. On June\n1, 1998, the Company effected a 2-for-1 stock split in the form of a stock\ndividend to stockholders of record on May 20, 1998. On January 4, 1999, the\nCompany effected a 3-for-1 stock split in the form of a stock dividend to the\nstockholders of record on December 18, 1998. Accordingly, the accompanying\nconsolidated financial statements have been restated to reflect these stock\nsplits.\n \n                                       40\n<PAGE>   41\n                                AMAZON.COM, INC.\n \n             NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (CONTINUED)\n \n  Stock Option Plans\n \n     The Company's stock option plans consist of the 1997 Stock Option Plan and\nthe 1994 Stock Option Plan. Shares reserved under the plans consist of 36.0\nmillion shares in the 1997 Stock Option Plan and 28.8 million shares in the 1994\nStock Option Plan. Any shares of common stock available for issuance under the\n1994 Stock Option Plan that are not issued under that plan may be added to the\naggregate number of shares available for issuance under the 1997 Stock Option\nPlan. In connection with the acquisition of Junglee and the merger with\nPlanetAll in August 1998, the Company assumed outstanding options to purchase\ncommon stock originally issued under these companies' stock option plans. The\nCompany's stock options plans as well as the assumed stock option plans are\nhereby collectively referred to as the \"Plans.\"\n \n     Generally, options are granted by the Company's Board of Directors at an\nexercise price of not less than the fair market value of the Company's common\nstock at the date of grant. Each outstanding option granted prior to December\n20, 1996 has a term of five years from the date of vesting. Each outstanding\noption granted on or subsequent to December 20, 1996 has a term of ten years\nfrom the date of grant. Subject to Internal Revenue Service limitations, options\ngranted under the Plans generally become exercisable immediately. Options\ngenerally vest at the rate of 20% after year one, 20% after year two and 5% at\nthe end of each quarter for years three through five. Shares issued upon\nexercise of options that are unvested are restricted and subject to repurchase\nby the Company upon termination of employment or services and such restrictions\nlapse over the original vesting schedule. At December 31, 1998, approximately\n3.9 million shares of restricted common stock were subject to repurchase.\n \n  Stock Option Activity\n \n     The following table summarizes the Company's stock option activity:\n \n<TABLE>\n<CAPTION>\n                                                        NUMBER          WEIGHTED-\n                                                          OF             AVERAGE\n                                                        SHARES        EXERCISE PRICE\n                                                    --------------    --------------\n                                                    (IN THOUSANDS)\n<S>                                                 <C>               <C>\nBalance January 1, 1996...........................      10,616           $ 0.024\n  Options granted and assumed.....................      15,600             0.102\n  Options canceled................................

The\nCompany has provided a full valuation allowance on the deferred tax asset,\nconsisting primarily of net operating loss carryforwards, because of uncertainty\nregarding its realizability.\n \n     At December 31, 1998, the Company had net operating loss carryforwards of\napproximately $207 million related to U.S. federal, foreign and state\njurisdictions. Utilization of net operating loss carryforwards may be subject to\ncertain limitations under Section 382 of the Internal Revenue Code of 1986, as\namended. Substantially all of these carryforwards will begin to expire at\nvarious times starting in 2011. To the extent that net operating loss\ncarryforwards, when realized, relate to stock option deductions of approximately\n$103 million, the resulting benefits will be credited to stockholders' equity.\n \n     Deferred income taxes reflect the net tax effects of temporary differences\nbetween the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting\npurposes and the amounts used for income tax purposes.
